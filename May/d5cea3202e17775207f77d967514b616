The Westwood gold mine, in Quebec, would resume operations in the second half of the year, owner Iamgold confirmed on Thursday. The company last month started recalling its employees and said that it would focus on training and rehabilitation work for the remainder of the quarter. When operations restart, it will be in the East zone and progress to other zones in a staged manner. Operations at the Westwood underground mine were suspended in November and 437 workers were laid off, after a seismic event. The mill restarted in November, processing stockpile and Grand Duc satellite openpit ore. Mill feed for the rest of the year would be sourced from Grand Duc, about 3 km from the Westwood mill complex, and would be supplemented by underground material from the Westwood mine. The companyâ€™s guidance for Westwood remained at 45 000 oz to 65 000 oz in 2021. Further, Iamgold reported that its Rosebel gold mine, in Suriname, had finalised a new collective agreement with the Rosebell Goldmines Werknemers Organisatie. The agreement applies to the two-year period until August 2022.
