Recently listed i-80 Gold has completed a $10-million property acquisition with the Christison family and Seven Dot Cattle to secure mineral and surface interests at its Getchell project, in Humboldt country, Nevada. The lands acquired include an about 42% interest in certain claims that host a significant portion of the openpit resource at Getchell and the potential extension of the Pinson underground deposit. The property interests also include private surface ownerships that will allow for the development of an openpit. i-80 also acquired an additional land section that will provide additional area that can be used for locating important infrastructure. The Getchell project represents one of i-80’s three core land holdings in Nevada and is host to both openpit and underground resources. i-80 Gold is a spinout of Premier Gold, which was taken over by Equinox Gold.
