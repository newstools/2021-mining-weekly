PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Diversified miner BHP has spent more than A$18-million in community funding across Western Australia, and more than A$8-million in the Pilbara, over the past year, the miner revealed this week. The funding formed part of the major’s A$50-million Vital Resources Fund, which was established to help support regional Australian communities surrounding its operations to manage the challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic. BHP Western Australia iron-ore asset president Brandon Craig said the funding had helped regional communities to navigate the challenges of the last year, and would set them up for continued success. “Over the past year we have provided over $18-million to organisations across Western Australia. This has included critical services such as local healthcare and mental health, business and financial support and Indigenous communities.” The Western Australian Council of Social Service received over A$1-million to help fund prevention and support programmes for family and domestic violence across the Pilbara. The Royal Flying Doctor Service (RFDS) also benefitted, receiving A$2-million, helping with the purchase of a new Pilatus PC-12 aeromedical aircraft. With one in four retrievals on a RFDS plane being from a mine site, the donation facilitated an enhanced service to regional communities who needed urgent medical attention.
