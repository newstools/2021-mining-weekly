Copper/gold explorer Adventus Mining said that Roberto Salas had resigned from its board on Friday, prior to the inauguration of Ecuador’s new government. Salas was CEO of Consorcio Nobis – one of Ecuador’s largest private organisations and a strategic investor in Adventus – and served on the junior’s board of directors as a nominee of Nobis. He is now the new Energy and Non-Renewable Natural Resources Minister in the Cabinet led by President Guilermo Lasso. “We wish Roberto well as he joins the new government of Ecuador and will surely contribute his extensive international business experience to Ecuador’s continuing economic and social development for all stakeholders,” said chairperson Mark Wellings. Adventus expected to receive and announce Nobis’ new board nominee ahead of its general meeting on June 10.
