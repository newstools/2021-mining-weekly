PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Renascor Resources has started bulk scale purified spherical graphite (PSG) production at its Siviour project, in South Australia. The company was last year granted approval for a 60 t bulk sample from its Siviour project that would be used in a pilot plant production trial, providing marketing samples to potential end-users and strategic partners. Renascor on Thursday said that 63 t of representative ore from the Siviour project had now been delivered to China for processing into graphite concentrates at a commercial graphite facility, and would be subsequently milled and purified into PSG using Renascor’s purification process. “We are excited to be producing large scale PSG samples as we continue to work with our prospective offtake partners towards final qualification and binding offtake agreements,” said Renascor MD David Christensen. “This bulk programme will permit us to meet large scale test work requirements of both our current offtake partners, as well as additional prospective purchasers of Siviour PSG.” The company has potential commitments covering more than 100% of Siviour’s Stage 1 PSG production for a period of ten years, with non-binding memoranda of understanding for 10 000 t/y each executed with a number of lithium-ion battery anode companies.
