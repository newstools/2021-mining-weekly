PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Beyondie sulphate of potash (SoP) project, in Western Australia, is on track to start commercial SoP production in September this year. ASX-listed Kalium Lakes on Thursday noted that potassium mixed salt harvesting continues in preparation for product commissioning, and that more than 93 000 t of contained SoP had been pumped at the end of April. “The power station for the Beyondie SoP project has now been commissioned and is ready to provide power for the process plant commissioning that is due to start in the next few weeks,” said CEO Rudolph van Niekerk. “This milestone, combined with harvesting activities that are in full swing and an operations team that is ready for production, represents a major step forward and significantly de-risks the project in meeting its first production targets. Importantly, the Beyondie SoP project remains on budget and on schedule to achieve first SoP sales next quarter.” Beyondie was initially expected to produce at a rate of 90 000 t/y, and would ramp up to 180 000 t/y incrementally. Van Niekerk noted that the SoP plant is entering its final stages of construction, with work fronts open to all disciplines, including electrical, instrumentation and piping work. “Completion of the standard grade SoP plant is being prioritized and this will be closely followed by completion of the compaction plant, which will use the standard SoP to produce granular SoP.”
