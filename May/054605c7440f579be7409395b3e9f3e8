Industry organisation the Mining Equipment Manufacturers of South Africa (Memsa) has appointed Lehlohonolo Amos Molloyi CEO and programmes manager. He plans to maximise the industry body's impact through advocacy and partnership to support localisation, transformation, technology development and skills development in support of a vibrant and growing South African mining supply chain serving domestic and export markets. He will lead the ongoing enhancement of Memsa's value proposition to members and partners and continue to build internal sustainability by broadening its membership base. Molloyi was part of Memsa at its foundation, when he represented founder member Kwanele Engineering Works in the cluster. Molloyi holds a National Higher Diploma in Extractive Metallurgy from the University of Johannesburg, and a Marketing Management certificate from the University of South Africa. He has 25 years’ experience as a process metallurgist and operations specialist and has spent his career working for mining companies Anglo Coal, AngloGold Ashanti, Gold Fields, Kumba Resources, TransHex and Etruscan Diamonds. Over the past decade, he has held leadership positions within medium-sized and emerging entities supplying the mining industry, allowing him to understand the challenges faced by Memsa’s diverse members. Memsa thanked part-time CEO Ossie Carstens, who steered and strengthened Memsa during his term over the past two years; he continues to contribute to the cluster as a board member. Molloyi takes over from Memsa vice-chairperson Christina Zondi, who served as acting CEO over the past months. The industry body aims to ensure Molloyi meets all Memsa's partners over the next few months.
