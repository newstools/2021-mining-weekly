Power utility Eskom has placed a senior manager in its coal procurement division on preliminary suspension, citing alleged corruption. This follows a whistle-blower tip-off to Eskom. After a preliminary investigation into the said employee, Eskom approached the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) for further investigation. "The SIU investigation revealed the senior manager to be in control of a bank account with a balance close to R12-million. "The funds have been deposited by some of Eskom’s suppliers in the coal division. The bank account has been frozen pending a full investigation and criminal charges and prosecution," the utility states. The employee will remain on suspension until a disciplinary hearing is held.
