PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Openpit mining has started at the Morila gold mine, in Mali. ASX-listed Firefinch on Thursday reported that some 100 000 t of ore from the Morila Pit 5 have already been hauled by contractor EGTF to the run-of-mine stockpiles, complementing the 530 000 t of ore mechanically mined from the tailings facility, and already stockpiled. The stockpiled ore would be used to commission the recently refurbished plant comminution circuit, which will start later this month. “It is very exciting to be off and running with our first openpit mining operation at Morila. The location of Pit 5 right next to our operating processing plant, combined with recent drilling results that enhanced economics, made it a compelling opportunity to fast-track first production before we commence mining at our other satellite deposits,” said Firefinch MD Dr Michael Anderson. “Importantly, all the work has been undertaken safely, and it is very pleasing to have engaged with the Malian-owned and -operated contractor EGTF, to resume mining at Morila Pit 5. Having taken these first steps, we of course remain very focused on the main prize: bringing the Morila super pit back into operation.” Firefinch earlier this month confirmed the life-of-mine plan for the Morila operation, which is expected to produce at an average rate of 160 000 oz/y to 2030, through the mining and processing of 37.5-million tonnes at 1.33 g/t gold for 1.45-million ounces of recovered gold. The mine will operate at a C1 cash cost of $962/oz and an all-in sustaining cost of $1 124/oz.
