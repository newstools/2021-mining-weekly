Toronto-based Wesdome Gold Mines on Wednesday announced the immediate restart of the Kiena Complex, in Val d’Or, Quebec, following the completion of a prefeasibility study (PFS) that yielded an internal rate of return (IRR) of 98%. The project, which has been under care and maintenance since mid-2013, would require a capital investment of C$230-million. The PFS capital cost is higher than the 2020 preliminary economic assessment estimate of C$121-million, owing to changes in the project scope that will allow for increased production and a longer mine life as additional resources are delineated. The asset already has significant infrastructure in place, including a shaft and 2 000 t/d mill and as such, could achieve initial production as early as the third quarter, CEO Duncan Middlemiss said in a statement. The mine would produce an average of 84 000 oz/y at an all-in sustaining cost of $676/oz. At a gold price of $1 600/oz, Kiena would deliver yearly free cashflow of C$85.5-million between 2022 and 2027. Kiena has an aftertax net present value of C$367-million, at $1 600/oz, increasing to C$491-million at $1 900/oz. The payback period is 2.7 years.
