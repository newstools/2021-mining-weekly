Internationally diversified gold producer Nordgold has launched a Covid-19 vaccination campaign at several of its mines. It is working with local authorities to safeguard the health of its employees, their families and surrounding communities, the company says. To date, 297 employees, or about 20%, have been immunised at the Berezitovy and Irokinda mines in Russia. Further, about 710 employees, or about 50% of its staff complement, as well as 115 subcontractors, at the Lefa mine, in Guinea, have received vaccinations. Nordgold says it is actively exploring a roll-out plan to deliver vaccinations at its remaining mines in Burkina Faso, Russia and Kazakhstan. “The safety of our employees and contractors has always been our absolute priority at Nordgold. Vaccination against the coronavirus will ensure that our people are protected, as well as reducing the risk of the virus spreading to others. “We are confident that our continuing vaccination programme will have a positive impact, helping us to all return to our usual mode of life and work,” says Nordgold CEO Nikolai Zelenski. Currently, all incoming rotational staff are quarantined and tested prior to arrival on site.
