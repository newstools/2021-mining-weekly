PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Junior Latitude Consolidated has reported a 44% increase in the global mineral resource for its Murchison gold project, in Western Australia. The Murchison project is now estimated to host some 13.1-million tonnes, grading 2.6 g/t gold for 1.11-million ounces of gold, following a 125% increase in the resource estimate for the Turnberry deposit. The Turnberry deposit, which is now estimated to host 610 000 oz of gold, forms a key part of the broader Murchison gold project, Latitude said on Tuesday. “We continue to build on our large existing high-grade gold resource and this 125% upgrade at Turnberry is a fantastic outcome for Latitude. In short order, we have been able to clearly demonstrate the true scale and growth potential of our high grade gold projects in the prolific Western Australian gold production region of the Murchison,” said Latitude CEO Tim Davidson. “Given the scale of mineralisation at Turnberry, the company is increasingly excited by the St Anne’s prospect, which lies 3.5 km to the south of Turnberry and displays similar grade and width characteristics to that seen at Turnberry in the limited drilling completed at the prospect to date. “We have a clear plan in place to grow the existing resource base through systematic drilling and with a suite of high-grade gold targets outside of the existing resource base we are looking forward to delivering further success,” said Davidson.
