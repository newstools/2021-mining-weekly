British Columbia has granted a permit for the B3 zone of the New Afton mine, west of Kamloops, paving the way for mining to begin this quarter, owner New Gold announced on Tuesday. The Mines Act permit was issued by the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation. “This is a significant milestone for the New Afton mine,” stated New Gold CEO and president Renaud Adams. “With the receipt of the B3 permit, ore extraction activities will begin this quarter and ramp up over the year. C-Zone development continues to advance with C-Zone extraction expected to begin in the second half of 2023.” The C-Zone permitting process was initiated during the first quarter with the submission of the pre-application package to authorities and Indigenous groups.
