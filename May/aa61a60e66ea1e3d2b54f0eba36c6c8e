Nouveau Monde Graphite, which is working towards developing a fully-integrated source of green battery anode material in Québec, will start trading on the NYSE on Monday. “As chairman, I am so proud of the Nouveau Monde team, and how we have so promptly secured a listing on the world’s largest and most important capital market, namely the New York Stock Exchange,” said Arne Frandsen on Wednesday. Achieving the milestone comes as Nouveau Monde has started work on its Phase 1 beneficiation plant, which early in 2022 is expected to start producing battery grade shaped, purified and coated graphite. “We remain committed to becoming North America’s largest fully integrated anode material production facility, and ultimately delivering our critical materials with zero carbon footprint from our Québec-based facilities.” In addition to listing and trading on the NYSE in US dollars, Nouveau Monde’s common shares continue to be listed and trade on the TSX-V in Canadian dollars. Nouveau Monde’s common shares will also continue to trade on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
