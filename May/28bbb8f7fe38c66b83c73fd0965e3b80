The Ontario government has agreed to assist TSX-V-listed Frontier Lithium with piloting a proprietary process that seeks to overcome certain risks identified with conventional lithium chemical processing used commercially outside North America. Ontario will contribute C$363Â 000 towards the mini-pilot programme. "This funding directly supports an operating mini-pilot programme addressing technical and financial risks associated with the company's patent pending lithium extraction process aiming to generate high-purity battery grade lithium hydroxide chemicals," said president and CEO Trevor Walker. "Current activities are delivering essential data for the company's assessment of various process and technology options to best commercialise Ontario's largest and highest-quality lithium resource for all stakeholders." Frontier aims to become a fully-integrated lithium producer of battery-quality lithium chemicals in North America's Great Lakes region from the PAK project, which hosts Ontario's largest and highest-grade lithium resource.
