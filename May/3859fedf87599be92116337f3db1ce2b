TSX- and NYSE American-listed Platinum Group Metals (PTM) says it has received notice that a group from the Kgatlu community, located near planned surface infrastructure associated with the Waterberg mine, in South Africa, has filed an application for an order in the High Court of South Africa to review and set aside the decision by the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment (DFFE) to dismiss an application for condonation for the late filing of an appeal by the group against the environmental authorisation that was granted for the mine in November 2020. The group has also requested that cause be shown as to why the environmental authorisation granted by the DFFE and the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy (DMRE) should not be set aside and referred back to the departments for further consideration. The grant of an environmental authorisation was a prerequisite to the granting of a mining right for the mine. PTM says it believes all requirements specified under the National Environmental Management Act, the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act and other applicable legislation haveÂ been complied with and that the DFFE correctly approved, and the DMRE correctly issued, the environmental authorisation. As an interested and affected party, and as a named respondent to the filed court action, Waterberg JV Resources is, accordingly, opposing the application to the High Court. PTM adds that it intends to continue consultations with the DMRE and recognised local authorities and community representatives on the plans for the Waterberg site. Waterberg JV Resources is a joint venture (JV) between PTM; Impala Platinum; Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation; Hanwa; and black economic empowerment partner Mnombo Wethu Consultants. PTM holds an effective 50.02% interest in the JV.
