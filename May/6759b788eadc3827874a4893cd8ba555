PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Manganese developer Element 25 (E25) has signed its first sales contract at its Butcherbird project, in Western Australia. The ASX-listed company on Wednesday reported that it had inked an agreement with a subsidiary of ASX-listed OM Holdings, and had delivered the first parcel of material from the Butcherbird project. “Delivering this first material under the offtake agreement within 12 months of publishing the prefeasibility study is a testament to the hard work and dedication of the project team,” said E25 MD Justin Brown. “This is another important milestone for the project and company and we are excited to be heading for our first shipment of Butcherbird material to our offtake partners.” E25 earlier this week signed a port access agreement with the Pilbara Port Authority, providing use of the Port Hedland Utah Point facility for the bulk export of manganese from the Butcherbird project. The Butcherbird project started production in March this year, and is expected to produce 341 000 t/y of manganese concentrate, at a grade of 33% manganese, over a mine life of 40 years.
