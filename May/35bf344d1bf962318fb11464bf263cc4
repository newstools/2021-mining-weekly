The environmental impact statement (EIS) for the processing facility of the Mt Peake vanadium/titanium/iron project, in the Northern Territory (NT), is facing a potential delay. The NT Environmental Protection Authority has asked owner TNG to provide additional information on the supplement to the draft EIS for the Tivan processing facility. The company has to address 23 matters, based on submissions from the NT government agencies and the Environment Centre NT, many of which were new and not previously required or raised at the draft EIS stage. TNG says that it is a “significant” amount of additional work and that the timeframe required to complete the work will be established in the coming weeks. Some of the work will require seasonally dependent biological surveys and significant new air quality modelling. “Our team is working to evaluate all options to ensure we achieve an expeditious final permitting resolution in a timeframe that matches the stage of development of the Mt Peake project, for which the FEED study is being finalised in preparation for project financing discussions,” comments MD and CEO Paul Burton. The federal government in March granted Mt Peake ‘major project’ status.
