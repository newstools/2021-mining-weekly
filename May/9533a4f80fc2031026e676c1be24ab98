LSE-listed Gem Diamonds has recovered a high-quality 254 ct Type II white diamond from its 70%-owned Letšeng mine, in Lesotho. Gem notes on its website that the Letšeng mine is renowned for its production of large, top colour, exceptional white diamonds, making it the highest average dollar per carat kimberlite diamond mine in the world. Gem in April reported that it had recovered 29 010 ct of diamonds at Letšeng in the quarter ended March 31. At the time, CEO Clifford Elphick commented that the production from the mining mix had not been as impressive as during the second half of 2020, with fewer large diamonds recovered as a result of the areas accessed under the mining plan. However, he noted that the mining mix was expected to improve over the coming months as the richer parts of the Satellite pit are accessed in accordance with the mine plan.
