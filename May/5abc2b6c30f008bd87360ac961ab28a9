PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner Resolute Mining has appointed Stuart Gale as MD and CEO effective immediately. Gale, who was previously employed as company CFO, was appointed as interim CEO and MD in October last year,  in October last year after John Welborn handed in his resignation. “It gives me great pleasure to confirm Gale’s appointment as MD and CEO of Resolute. Over the past six months, the board retained a leading global search adviser who undertook a comprehensive CEO candidate search process,” said chairperson Martin Botha. “Throughout this period, Gale has provided excellent leadership as interim CEO, and clearly proven himself as the leading candidate for the role. Achieving this while retaining his CFO duties is also a testament to his professionalism and capability.” The company has now appointed Terry Holohan as COO, effective from May 17. Holohan has previously held a number of executive and detailed technical positions working in Africa as well as Asia, and joins the company from PT Archi Indonesia, where he successfully developed and expanded a multi openpit gold mine from an exploration project to operational mine. Current COO David Kelly will remain with Resolute to ensure a smooth transition of the COO function, and will continue as a member of the executive team. The gold miner will start a search process to fill the CFO role previously held by Gale.
