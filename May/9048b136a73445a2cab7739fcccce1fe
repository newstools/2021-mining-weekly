TSX-listed mine development company NorZinc has appointed Rohan Hazelton as new CEO, succeeding Don MacDonald, who is stepping down as director and CEO after three years in these roles. Chairperson John Warwick thanked MacDonald for his service and welcomed Hazelton to the company. “His [Hazelton’s] deep experience in corporate and mine development aligns with our aim to build a world-class mining company. Rohan has an impressive track record of advancing mining companies through financing, development and production. I am confident his entrepreneurial spirit and skills will be strong assets for NorZinc, and will help advance the company to its next stages of maturity." Hazelton has more than 20 years of leadership experience in the mining industry. Prior to joining NorZinc, he was CFO of both Cerrado Gold and Ascendant Resources, and co-founded KORE Mining, serving as KORE's CEO.  Prior to that, he worked at Goldcorp and its predecessor Wheaton River Minerals as one of its earliest employees. NorZinc is developing its key project, the 100%-owned high grade silver/zinc/lead Prairie Creek project, located in the Northwest Territories.
