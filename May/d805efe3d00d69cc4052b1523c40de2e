Junior Anglo Australian has announced a maiden resource of 500 000 oz at its Mandilla deposit, demonstrating the large-scale openpit potential of the Western Australian gold project. The project, encompassing the Mandilla East and Mandilla South deposits, has a mineral resource estimate of 15.6-million tonnes at 1 g/t gold. “This is a great result for our shareholders, reflecting the success of our drilling programmes over the past two years. In a relatively short space of time, we have been able to declare a very robust maiden mineral resource of just over half-a-million ounces right on the doorstep of Kalgoorlie – one of the world’s greatest mining jurisdictions,” said MD Marc Dulcer. Inclusive of the mineral resource at the Feysville gold project, also near Kalgoorlie, of 2.9-million tonnes at 1.3 g/t gold for 116 100 oz, Anglo Australian’s total resource inventory now stands at 18.4-million tonnes at 1 g/t gold for 616 500 oz. The combination of Mandilla and Feysville moves the company closer to having a critical mass of inventory necessary to evaluate an integrated gold mining and processing operation, based on a suitably scaled central processing hub at Mandilla with satellite ore transported from Feysville.
