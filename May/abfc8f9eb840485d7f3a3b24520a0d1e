Exploration and development company GoviEx Uranium has received a letter from Zambia’s Mining Cadastre department notifying it that the previously cancelled Chirundu mining licence has been reinstated. The reinstatement of the mining licence, however, remains subject to the completion of certain exploration and development milestones to advance the licence towards final feasibility study. “We are very pleased and warmly welcome the decision made by the Mining Cadastre concerning the reinstatement of the Chirundu mining licence and believe this decision was well considered and in the best interests of all stakeholders, both in Zambia and abroad. “The Zambian government has indicated its strategy to diversify its mining industry from the heavy weighting of base metals and advancing its long-term desire to include uranium and clean baseload nuclear power as part of its economic development plans,” says GoviEx executive chairperson Govind Friedland. He notes that, as the uranium market improves, the company plans to reinvigorate the development of the Mutanga project, starting with targeted resource exploration drilling later this year. “We look forward to advancing and deepening our long-term and mutually beneficial relationship with the Republic of Zambia,” Friedland states. The Chirundu mining licence was acquired from ASX-listed African Energy Resources in October 2017 and includes the Njame and Gwabe mineral deposits. Since acquiring the Chirundu mining licence, GoviEx has ensured all statutory reports and payments have been made, and in addition has expanded its community and social responsibility programmes to cover the villages within the licence area, including the reconstruction of a school and the start of an adult education programme, it says.
