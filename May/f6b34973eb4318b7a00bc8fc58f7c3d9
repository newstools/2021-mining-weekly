PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner Newcrest Mining has set a goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 for its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. “Given our experience with identifying and applying innovative technologies, Newcrest has the potential to be at the forefront of meeting the challenge of net zero carbon emissions by 2050,” said MD and CEO Sandeep Biswas. “As an industry more broadly, we have the ingenuity, technology and capability to take on this challenge and reduce our carbon footprint. We are seeing the rapid evolution of a range of new technologies that will help reduce emissions going forward, and Newcrest is well positioned to leverage this technology as the world moves toward a zero-carbon future.” The company in 2019 set targets to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emission intensity by 30% by 2030, with Biswas saying the company has made significant progress to date, including GHG management plans for each operating site, securing renewable sources of energy, and assessing the impact on the company’s business under selected climate change scenarios in line with Paris Agreement goals.
