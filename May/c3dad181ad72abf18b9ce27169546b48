Nevada-based gold developer Millennial Precious Metals has engaged Eric Tremblay, the COO of Dalradian Resources and former GM at Canadian Malartic, as a technical adviser. A mining professional with nearly 30 years of mine building and operations experience, Tremblay previously also worked at Cambior’s Sleeping Giant mine, the Mouska mine and Barrick’s Doyon mine. CEO Jason Kosec said that Tremblay’s technical expertise would be an “incredible asset” in Millennial’s mission of becoming a multimillion-ounce, multi-asset development company. Millennial also announced the appointment of Sara Heston as a technical adviser. She is currently a director of The Denver Gold Group, Spanish Mountain and Dore Copper Mining.
