PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Oil and gas major Woodside has inked a heads of agreement with IHI Corporation and Marubeni Corporation to investigate the production and export of green ammonia produced from renewable hydro power in Tasmania. The companies said in a joint statement on Thursday that initially, the green ammonia would be produced at a small-scale hydrogen electrolysis plant, with Woodside exploring options for production in the Bell Bay region, in north-east Tasmania. The capacity of the proposed plant could eventually be scaled up to as much as 250 MW to produce green hydrogen as feedstock for green ammonia exports. The companies said in a statement that the initial phase of the partners’ studies would focus on deepening their understanding of Japanese and Asian ammonia markets, with technical and commercial evaluations under way. Woodside last year inked an agreement with a Japanese consortium to study exporting hydrogen as ammonia for use in decarbonizing coal-fired power generation in Japan. The consortium, which consists of JERA Inc, Marubeni Corporation and IHI Corporation, received approval from Japan’s New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organisation for a feasibility study covering the entire hydrogen-as-ammonia value chain.
