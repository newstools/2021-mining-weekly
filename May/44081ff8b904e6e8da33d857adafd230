A former Barberton mine administrative clerk was arrested on Tuesday for his alleged part in fraud that caused the mine a loss of more than R1.1 million. Bhekinkosi Fana Madonsela, 30, appeared before the Barberton Magistrate's Court on Tuesday after members of the Hawks' Serious Commercial Crime Investigation team arrested him. It is alleged that he received an undue payment of R300 000 from his accomplices. Precious Nontobeko Magongo, 36, also a former mine employee, was arrested in March and was the first person to be arrested in connection with the fraud. It is alleged that Magongo received an undue payment of R497 885, said Hawks spokesperson Captain Dineo Lucy Sekgotodi. "These undue payments were reportedly carried out by the main suspect, Simphiwe Sangwenyi, 38, also a mine employee [who was working as a financial administrator]. Sangweni is still being sought by the Hawks and a warrant of arrest was issued by court on the 5 November 2020 against him," she said. It is alleged that Sangweni transferred money from the mine account to his personal account and then distributed it to different accounts belonging to Magongo and Madonsela. An internal investigation was conducted. Sekgotodi said the three people colluded and caused the mine to lose a total of R1 156 700 "through misrepresentation". Madonsela's case was postponed to 12 July and he was released on R5 000 bail. Anyone who has information that can lead to the arrest of Sangweni is requested to contact investigating officer Captain Dietlof Meyer on 071 481 2977.
