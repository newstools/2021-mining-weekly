Labour unions the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) and the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) on May 20 said State-owned power utility Eskom's management team had refused to "engage meaningfully" in ongoing wage negotiations. In a joint statement, the unions said Eskom was attempting to “frustrate” the process. The unions have demanded a 15% wage increase for Eskom employees and say Eskom is offering only a 1.5% increase. The unions alleged that Eskom’s offer was conditional on workers having to accept changes to their benefits and conditions. In addition, the unions have demanded an increase in employees' housing allowances and the closing of what they call an “Apartheid wage gap”.
