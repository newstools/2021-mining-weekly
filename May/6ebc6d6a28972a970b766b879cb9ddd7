Toronto-listed Equinox Gold has exercised its anti-dilution right by subscribing for another 5.5-million new shares at C$2.60 each in spin-out i-80. "The exercise of Equinox's anti-dilution right further strengthens our balance sheet and I believe demonstrates Equinox's commitment to the work with i-80 as we aggressively grow our business in Nevada," stated i-80 CEO Ewan Downie. Nevada-focused i-80 recently issued shares to complete the acquisition of Osgood Mining, the owner of the Getchell mining project from Waterton Global Resource Management.
