Norway-based gold exploration company Akobo Minerals, which has operations in Ethiopia, says it intends to carry out an equity private placement and apply for a listing of the company’s shares on Euronext Growth Oslo during this year. Details of the contemplated equity financing have not yet been determined. The company has mandated SpareBank 1 Markets AS to arrange a series of equity investor meetings and calls, starting May 25. There is no guarantee that the process will lead to the company’s shares being admitted to trading on Euronext Growth Oslo, it notes. Any contemplated equity financing will be subject to customary selling restrictions and only be directed towards investors subject to applicable exemptions from relevant prospectus requirements.
