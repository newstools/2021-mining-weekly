ASX- and LSE-listed potash miner Danakali reports that the construction of a reverse osmosis (RO) water treatment plant at its Colluli potash project, in Eritrea, is under way and will soon undergo function testing. Following this, the $1.6-million plant, which is being built by WEC Projects in South Africa, will be shipped to Massawa, in Eritrea, in three to four months’ time. Colluli is 100%-owned by the Colluli Mining Share Company – a 50:50 joint venture between Danakali and the Eritrean National Mining Corporation (Enamco). Danakali executive chairperson Seamus Cornelius says everyone involved in Colluli – partners, Enamco and shareholders – want to see progress and the RO plant which will make fresh water available at site. The RO plant, he says, is an essential part of the Colluli project and the early works programme at the project site.
