Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) President Felix Tshisekedi visited the operations of Glencore’s Kamoto Copper Company (KCC) in Kolwezi, on May 13, in recognition of the miner’s near $8-billion investment in the country. KCC is a joint venture (JV) between Glencore and DRC commodity trading and mining company Gécamines, which conforms to the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process standard for cobalt as defined by the Responsible Minerals Initiative. The visiting delegation also included DRC Prime Minister Sama Lukonde, Mines Minister Antoinette N’Samba, Lualaba province deputy governor Fifi Masuka and Gécamines chairperson Albert Yuma, as well as Glencore CEO Ivan Glasenberg and other senior company representatives, along with Embassy of Switzerland in the DRC deputy chief of mission Daniel Freihofer. KCC represents a key part of Glencore’s investment in the DRC, with its modern infrastructure and a significant copper/cobalt orebody, which the company states makes the operation a key component to achieving the global energy and mobility transitions. Following its successful ramp-up in 2020, KCC is on track to achieve nameplate capacity of 300 000 t/y of copper and 30 000 t/y of cobalt production. Glasenberg says Glencore is honoured that Tshisekedi and senior members of his government have recognised its ongoing commitment to and investment in the DRC by visiting KCC. “Glencore looks forward, together with our JV partner Gécamines, to continuing to build on the long-standing local and national partnerships that have been the foundation of our investment in the DRC,” he says. The DRC has a critical role to play in the ongoing energy and mobility transitions, states Glasenberg, adding that Glencore remains committed to ensuring its KCC and Mutanda operations play their part through the responsible supply of copper and cobalt for use by customers around the world.
