Aim-listed Altus Strategies has been granted three new distinct exploration projects, as well as exploration licences adjacent to existing projects totalling 221 km2 in Morocco. The projects were awarded to the company's 100%-owned subsidiary, Aterian Resources, as part of a competitive tender process. These projects increase the company’s Moroccan portfolio to ten projects, totalling 675 km2. In addition to the new projects, it has also been granted licence blocks contiguous with its existing Takzim and Zaer copper projects. The new projects are all located in the Central Moroccan Hercynian Massif, a region that is highly prospective for copper, tin, tungsten, lead and zinc and that hosts numerous active and historical mines, as well as development-stage projects. "Our field team will commence exploration shortly, focusing on the priority targets defined by satellite image interpretations. “Altus has applied for a number of further projects across Morocco through the tender process and we look forward to providing an update on the results of these submissions in due course,” says Altus CE Steven Poulton.
