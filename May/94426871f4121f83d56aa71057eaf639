PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner Firefinch has marked the second stage of its ramp-up strategy at the Morila gold mine, in Mali, announcing the commissioning of the comminution circuit. Commissioning of the comminution circuit was done using feed from the Morila Pit 5 as well as stockpiles. “It was only last week that I expressed excitement about commencing mining operations at Morila Pit 5. Now the team is commissioning the comminution circuit, and Morila Pit 5 ore will be fed today. What an outcome, and what tremendous momentum we have,” said Firefinch MD Dr Mike Anderson. Openpit mining of Morila’s satellite pits is targeted to increase production from around 50 000 oz of gold in 2021 to some 120 000 oz of gold in 2022, according to Firefinch’s growth strategy. Since acquiring the gold mine in November of last year, the ASX-listed company has started a programme of work to refurbish key steel structures in the comminution circuit, prepare the crushers, screens and all components of the plant for operation. Preparatory work has also included an upgrade of the dump pocket structures, embankment stabilisation and drainage upgrades. Commissioning of the oxide circuit started in May this year, using feed from run-of mine stockpiles. Direct tipping of the Morila Pit 5 feed started this week. The oxide circuit will be ramped up to some three-million tonnes a year in the coming days.
