Murray & Roberts (M&R) subsidiary Clough has been awarded a R1.1-billion contract for the engineering, procurement and construction of the Tallawarra B gas turbine power station in New South Wales, Australia. Tallawarra B is a 300 MW expansion of the existing Tallawarra A power station. M&R's Energy, Resources & Infrastructure platform trades under the Clough brand, a brand associated with providing project service excellence for more than 100 years on large and technically and logistically challenging projects in the energy, resources and infrastructure industries. The platform has done well by establishing a good market position in the specialist infrastructure and resources growth sectors in Australia, both sectors which are expected to remain buoyant over the next decade.
