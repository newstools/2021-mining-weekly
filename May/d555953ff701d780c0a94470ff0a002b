Copper miner Antofagasta on Wednesday announced two new greenhouse gas reduction targets, as part of its climate change strategy and its wider commitment to operate sustainably. The first target is to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 30%, or 730 000 t of carbon dioxide equivalent, by 2025, relative to 2020. The second, longer-term target, is to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, or earlier if technologies are developed over the coming years that will accelerate that goal. “These new targets will ensure Antofagasta continues to make important progress on its pledge to protect the environment, while generating sustainable returns for our shareholders,” said CEO Ivan Arriagada.
