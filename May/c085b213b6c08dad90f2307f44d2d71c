Graphite and gold explorer Volt Resources has received the backing of European investment company JES Green Investments to fund its graphite acquisition in Ukraine. The ASX-listed company reported on Thursday that it had executed a term sheet with JES for a 8.5-million debt facility to assist with its acquisition of a 70% interest in the Zavalievsky (ZG) group of companies. Volt chairperson Asimwe Kabunga has offered his Volt shareholding as security for the loan. The acquisition of a controlling interest in ZG will transform Volt into one of the few Australia-listed graphite producers.
