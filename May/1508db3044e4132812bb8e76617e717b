PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Junior Antipa Minerals has reported a 62% increase in the mineral resource estimate for the Cailbre gold deposit, in Western Australia. The deposit is now estimated to host some 2.1-million ounces of gold, 103 700 t of copper and 1.3-million ounces of silver, at 0.72 g/t gold, with the new resource incorporating drilling results from 2020. “This outstanding result confirms that Calibre, which was discovered by Antipa, is a very large scale copper/gold/silver mineral system with significant growth potential located in the rapidly advancing tier one Paterson Province,” said Antipa MD Roger Mason. “The strategic significance of this deposit is supported by this year’s substantial A$24.5-million Citadel project exploration programme which has the potential to both further increase the project’s resource and enhance potential development options.” The Calibre deposit is located 45 km east of major Rio Tinto’s Winu copper/gold/silver deposit on the Citadel joint venture area.
