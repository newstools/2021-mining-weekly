Aim-listed Oriole Resources says it has been made aware of delays at the assaying laboratory in CÃ´te d'Ivoire that have impacted turnaround times for the remaining results of the maiden diamond drilling programme at its 51%-owned Bibemi gold project, in Cameroon. The laboratory is reportedly struggling amid national power outages. The Oriole team had completed the drilling programme on April 25 for a total 3 118 m in 29 holes.
