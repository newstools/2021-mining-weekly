Toronto-listed NextSource has started procurement of processing plant equipment for its Molo graphite mine, in Madagascar, ahead of expected mine construction starting in August. Purchase orders have been placed for primary, flash flotation and attrition mills, flotation columns and cleaning circuits, as well as screeners, crushers and feeders. The processing plant is designed to process 240 000 t/y of ore and produce about 17 000 t/y of high-quality super flake graphite concentrate. Mine commissioning is targeted for April next year. Earlier this year, NextSource secured a $29.5-million financing package from Mick Davis’ Vision Blue investment firm for the Molo project.
