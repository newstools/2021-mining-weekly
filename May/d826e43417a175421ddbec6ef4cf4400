Platinum group metals (PGMs) and chrome miner Tharisa expects its basic earnings per share (EPS) and headline earnings per share (HEPS) for the six months ended March 31 to be between $0.21 and $0.22. That compares with the EPS and HEPS of $0.036 and $0.037, respectively, reported for the six months ended March 31, 2020. The miner further attributes the higher expected earnings to operational improvements on all measured metrics, as well as an improved PGMs basket price and increased chrome concentrate prices. Tharisaâ€™s reviewed interim condensed consolidated financial statements are expected to be released on, or about, May 27.
