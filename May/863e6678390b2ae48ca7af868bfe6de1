PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Junior Province Resources has inked a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Shire of Carnarvon, in the Gascoyne region of Western Australia, to collaborate on the potential development of a green hydrogen project. The MoU will focus on further investigating suitable areas for developing infrastructure as part of Province’s plans to develop its HyEnergy Zero Carbon Hydrogen project. Province MD David Frances said that the MoU provided greater confidence that the company was not only operating in a region of world-class wind and solar potential, but also with the mutual support of a progressive local shire. “Our recent binding MoU executed with global renewable energy leader Total Eren to perform a feasibility study in view of potentially developing an up to 8 GW renewable power facility demonstrates our clear intention to be a major green hydrogen company, and with local and state government support, I believe the Gascoyne region has the potential to become a leading global supplier of green hydrogen products, boosting local industry and jobs.” Province's proposed HyEnergy Zero Carbon hydrogen project is expected to be one of the largest commercial scale green hydrogen projects globally. Under the terms of the MoU between Province and Total Eren, the partners would complete a scoping study on the proposed hydrogen project and are targeting the execution of definitive agreements within the next four months.
