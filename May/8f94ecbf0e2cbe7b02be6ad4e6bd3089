TSX-listed Deep-South Resources has appointed the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (Csiro) to conduct bio-assisted heap leaching column test work, which is part of the company’s recently announced metallurgical test work for its Haib copper project, in Namibia. METS Engineering Group of Australia has been appointed to supervise and overview the test work. "With the drilling programme under way, we are delighted to initiate a collaboration with Csiro, Australia’s national science agency, which is a leader in scientific research and bio-assisted heap leaching technologies. “The main aim of this test work is to improve copper recoveries and thereby improve the Haib copper project's robust economics,” says Deep-South president and CEO Pierre Leveille. The goals of the bio-assisted heap leaching test work include the evaluation of the performance of promising solvent extraction reagents for extraction and separation of copper and molybdenum and monitor and evaluate the adaptation of bacterial strains for improved ore processing. The test work will also monitor and evaluate percolation performance. The test work will mainly serve to optimise the bio-assisted heap leaching processes with the ore at Haib.
