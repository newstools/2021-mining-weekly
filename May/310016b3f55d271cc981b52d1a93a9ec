Initial assay results and an exploration update on tin miner Alphamin Resources’ Mpama South exploration drilling programme has confirmed high-grade tin mineralisation at the project in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. So far, 8 700 m of the planned 16 000 m diamond drill programme has been completed. CEO Maritz Smith says the drill results are “very encouraging” for the prospect and that it exceeded the company’s expectations. He adds that mineralisation within the main and footwall zones point to another high-grade deposit. “We are encouraged by the mineral resource expansion potential within our mining permit, and our view that the 13-km-long Bisie Ridge hosts multiple high-grade mineralised systems continues to be reinforced by these results,” he commented, noting that this brings Alphamin closer to realising its vision of “becoming one of the world’s largest long-life tin producers”. The drilling programme forms part of Alphamin’s exploration initiative for 2021, which aims to extend the life-of-mine at its currently producing Mpama North mine, and to declare a maiden mineral resource for the Mpama South prospect, as well as to discover at least one additional deposit on the highly prospective Bisie Ridge.
