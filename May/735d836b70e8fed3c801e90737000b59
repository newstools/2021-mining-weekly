PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Coal miner Coronado Global Resources is facing court charges over a fatality at its Curragh mine, in Queensland, which occurred in January of last year. An employee of contractor Thiess was critically injured last year after becoming trapped in machinery at the mine. Activities at the mine were suspended following the incident, but production resumed again in the June quarter. Coronado told shareholders on Tuesday that legal charges have now been issued in the Emerald Magistrates Court against subsidiary Coronado Curragh and one of its employees in relation to the incident. “The safety of our people is our most important priority and we are committed to working hard every day to create an injury-free workplace. We acknowledge the significant impact this incident has had on [the employee’s] family and loved ones, and we again express our deepest sympathies to his family and co-workers,” the company said in a statement. Coronado was reviewing the charges, but did not comment further.
