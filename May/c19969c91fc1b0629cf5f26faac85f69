Mineral resource company GoviEx Uranium has executed a drilling contract with Zambia-based drilling company Hydro Tech Drilling & Exploration to undertake exploration and resource delineation drilling programmes at the company’s Mutanga uranium project, in Zambia. “With the reissued Chirundu mining permit, we are keen to get back to advancing our Zambian assets with the development of Mutanga,” says CEO Daniel Major. The project benefits from simple and straightforward operations owing to low waste stripping, low acid consumption and low capital expenditure requirements. The mine plan currently forecasts an 11-year mine life and the drill targets identified through trenching indicate potential for resource extension, making it a long-life project for the company. Major also confirms that metallurgical test work has already been undertaken to a prefeasibility study standard, “providing considerable confidence” on the process route considered. GoviEx has planned an 8 000 m down-hole percussion drilling programme, focused on the Dibwe East deposit and new areas defined by previous trench sampling east of Dibwe East. In addition, the company will start the installation of water points in the nearby village of Hachibozu, which will include drilling a water well, the installation of a wind pump and a water tank. This is part of the company’s corporate social responsibility programme and aimed at helping to facilitate access to water within the village.
