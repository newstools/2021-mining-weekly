Multinational miner Anglo American has published its seventh yearly Tax and Economic Contribution Report, with a detailed breakdown of the company’s contributions across all its major operating jurisdictions, which amounted to more than $25-billion in 2020. “The enduring positive impact of a business can only be properly assessed when you consider the total footprint of its contributions. It is with this transparency that we seek to build trust as a corporate leader in our industry – a key pillar of our Sustainable Mining Plan. "The positive contribution we bring to the countries where we operate extends far beyond the taxes and royalties we pay. The high quality of employment that we provide and the associated wages, the money we spend with local suppliers, our corporate social investment and our capital investments, all support the fabric of many economies,” CEO Mark Cutifani says. He notes that the company’s contribution in 2020 demonstrated the extent to which Anglo continued contributing to the communities and countries where it works, both economically and socially. For 2020, total taxes borne and collected was $5.3-billion; wages and related payments was $3.6-billion; corporate social investment was $100-million; total procurement was $12.6-billion and capital investment was $4.1-billion; with a total of $25.7-billion.
