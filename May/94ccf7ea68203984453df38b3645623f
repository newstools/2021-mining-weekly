London-listed mining company Vast Resources has appointed Nicolae Turdean as Romanian country manager to work alongside the newly appointed management team at the Baita Plai polymetallic mine and in conjunction with the CEO in the advancement of the company’s wider strategic objectives in the country. Turdean began his career more than 40 years ago in the Romanian mining industry and his knowledge of the jurisdiction, geology and regulatory environment should prove to be highly valuable as Vast looks to implement its upgraded mine plan at Baita Plai. "Nicolae is a pre-eminent figure in the Romanian mining industry and he and I will be working closely as we look to execute our upgrade plans at Baita Plai, and thereafter expand our operations to the pipeline of development opportunities we have in Romania. “His high-level access to various regulatory bodies and industry associations will complement the significant networks that we have already developed in the country,” commented CEO Andrew Prelea. Most recently, Turdean held the position of president of the National Agency for Mineral Resources after previously working as a mining expert for the agency.
