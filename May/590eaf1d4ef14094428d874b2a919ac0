PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed WA Kaolin has inked a 15-year liquefied natural gas (LNG) supply contract for its Wickepin kaolin project with Mid-West LNG. Mid-West LNG is a group company of Lean Energy Fuels Australia (CEFA), which is currently investigating new production plans and associated LNG infrastructure to provide lower emission fuel to rural regions of Australia. “We are thrilled to have entered into a 15-year contract with CEFA and one of Western Australia’s leading energy solutions providers,” said WA Kaolin CEO Andrew Sorensen. “As we continue to progress our stage 1 work programme towards our target to be producing by year-end, it is vital for our development programme that we lock in such important long-term supplier agreements like this. “The stage 1 work programme at Wickepin continues on track and within budget, and I look forward to providing the market with a further update of progression from on site shortly.” The Wickepin project is estimated to host a mineral resource of some 644.5-million tonnes of high grade premium kaolinised granite, and the project is expected to produce at a rate of 400 000 t/y from 2023, and will have a mine life of some 30 years.
