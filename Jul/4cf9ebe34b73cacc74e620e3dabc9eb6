The 3.8-million-tonne-a-year concentrator plant built as part of Phase 1 of the Kamoa-Kakula project, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), is now fully operational. Ivanhoe Mines reports that the first truckloads of copper concentrate were delivered to a local smelter on June 1, with concentrate dispatch continuing daily. To date, more than 10 500 dry metric tonnes of concentrate have been delivered to the local smelter and the first blister copper ingots have been received. Ivanhoe subsidiary Kamoa Copper in June signed copper concentrate and blister copper offtake agreements, on competitive arm's-length commercial terms, with Citic Metal and Gold Mountains International Mining Company, a subsidiary of Zijin Mining Group, for 50% each of the copper products from Kamoa-Kakula’s Phase 1 production. The company also secured all necessary authorisations to start exports of copper products from the Kamoa-Kakula mine to international markets. “The past month was dedicated to the Phase 1 plant commissioning, after celebrating Kamoa’s first concentrate production on May 25. The team has moved on steadily with C4 plant commissioning. This is expected to take approximately four months, with incremental improvements in production expected as the plant is fully ramped up to design capacity. "It was a very encouraging operational performance in June. We expect to achieve copper production for the remainder of the year in line with guidance, and solid progress also is being made on the Phase 2 concentrator plant construction, which is still tracking ahead of schedule,” comments Kamoa Copper CEO Mark Farren. Ivanhoe’s guidance for contained copper in concentrate production at Kamoa-Kakula for the balance of this year is 80 000 t to 95 000 t. Kamoa Copper is a joint venture between Ivanhoe (39.6%), Zijin Mining Group (39.6%), Crystal River Global Limited (0.8%) and the DRC government (20%).
