Norway-based gold explorer Akobo Minerals has procured a second drill rig to start core drilling on the Segele gold project, in Ethiopia. The drilling is an important part of increasing the project’s mineral resource, advancing the Joru target in particular and supporting ongoing mining studies, Akobo reports. “This doubling in operational activity allows us to increase the confidence in the resources and extract samples for metallurgical testing – both of which are vital contributions to the scoping study and anticipated preliminary feasibility study,” says CEO Jørgen Evjen. The contract with the drill supplier, Midroc Geo/Exploration Services, based in Addis Ababa, allows for at least 3 000 m of core to be drilled and for extensions in increments of 3 000 m. The contractor is expected to drill at least 1 000 m a month.
