Mineral sands miner Richards Bay Minerals (RBM) has agreed to reserve 50% of its currently available general worker jobs for members of the Sokhulu community. KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala on July 8 said RBM would resume operations on July 12. He briefed the media on the efforts led by the government to resolve the impasse between RBM and the Sokhulu community. RBM, which is majority-owned by diversified major Rio Tinto, on June 30 suspended operations after violent protests. “As part of the provincial government’s concerted efforts to save the multibillion-rand investment by RBM, we met with various stakeholders to deal with security concerns and challenges that have led to the company’s decision to halt operations and declare force majeure,” Zikalala said. “We recognise the immense economic impact that RBM's operations has in the region and we believe the operations and its employees must be protected,” he added. The provincial government recognised the concerns raised by the host communities but emphasised that such concerns should be raised in a nonviolent way. “We are pleased to report to the public that both RBM and the Sokhulu community have found common ground on a number of issues, while some have been referred for further engagement." Zikalala said the provincial Department of Community Safety and Liaison, the South African Police Service and the eThekwini municipality would monitor the area and ensure the situation returns to normal.
