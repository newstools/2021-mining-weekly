Diversified miner Rio Tinto’s South African subsidiary Richards Bay Minerals (RBM) has confirmed there are still “fundamental milestones” that must be met before its operations, in KwaZulu-Natal, can be resumed. This follows after the mineral sands mining company suspended operations on June 30, owing to violent protests. The community has had a prolonged dispute with the mine, including a traditional leadership squabble and another in which locals demand to be employed at the mine. The latest unrest followed the shooting death of RBM operational service GM Nico Swart on May 24, as he was on his way to work. KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala on July 9 said RBM would resume operations this week after government and Rio Tinto and RBM’s management had held talks. RBM CEO Werner Duvenhage, however, maintains that operations will not likely resume until all issues are resolved. “We need assurance on the guaranteed safety of our employees and an immediate stoppage of attacks directed at our operations and assets.” The company has been meeting with supporting authorities, including regional and national government, community structures and the South African Police Service, to devise solutions for restoring calm and order in the area.
