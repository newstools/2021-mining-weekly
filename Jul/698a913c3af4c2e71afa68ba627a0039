PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Dual-listed lithium miner Orocobre is expecting strong results for the quarter ended June, on the back of increased production. The ASX- and TSX-listed miner on Friday told shareholders that production during the June quarter had reached 3 300 t of lithium carbonate, compared with the 3 232 t achieved in the March quarter.

Furthermore, the Olaroz facility noted that sales for lithium carbonate were also up in the June quarter, with prices up 45% on the March quarter results, with lithium prices over the last nine months increasing by more than 170%. The company is expected to release its quarterly production report later this month.
