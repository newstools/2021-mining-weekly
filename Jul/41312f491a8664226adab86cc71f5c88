The contract will provide for maintenance and shutdown services across Fortescue’s Pilbara operations. “Fortescue is committed to supporting sustainable long-term opportunities for Aboriginal businesses. Procurement is one of the most powerful levers for social and economic change, and from experience we know that a strong Aboriginal business sector is best placed to create employment and development opportunities for their communities,” said Fortescue CEO Elizabeth Gaines. “I am pleased to announce this significant contract with Warrikal, the largest to be awarded by Fortescue and also among the biggest contracts to be awarded in Australia to a majority owned Aboriginal business.” Fortescue’s Billion Opportunities programme was established in 2011 as part of the company’s commitment to deliver business development opportunities for Aboriginal people with a strong focus on Traditional Custodian involvement.
