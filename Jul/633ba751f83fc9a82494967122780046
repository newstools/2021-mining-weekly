PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Mining operations have restarted at the Granny Venn gold project, in Western Australia. ASX-listed Resources & Energy Group on Thursday told shareholders that the start of operations followed the approval of the project management plan, with first drill and blasting operations having been carried out on Monday. The production schedule for Granny Venn has identified a near-term production target of some 120 000 t of ore, at 2.3 g/t gold for 8 800 oz of gold over a five-year period. Based on the production schedule, first ore is expected in early August, and first milling is slated for September. Resources & Energy on Thursday said that exploration around the project area was still under way, with the aim of discovering up to one-million ounces of gold. Work on expanding exploration across the broader project area has started, with over nine walk-up targets identified for initial drill investigation, and a further 21 for a combination of regional air-core, soil geochemistry and geophysical enquiry.
