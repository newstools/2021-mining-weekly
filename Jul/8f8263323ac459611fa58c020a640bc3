PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Calidus Resources is on track to start gold production at its Warrawoona project, in the Pilbara, during the June quarter of 2022. The junior company on Monday reported that construction of Warrawoona is advancing in line with budget and schedule, with mining works now under way in preparation for the first blast. “With the start of blasthole drilling and construction progressing on time and budget, Calidus can now say with confidence that it will be Australia’s next gold producer,” said MD Dave Reeves. “The activity on site is accelerating as the bulk of the civil works is completed at the processing plant, allowing mechanical and structural erection to commence in the near future.” An updated prefeasibility study into the Warrawoona project found that some 623 086 oz of gold could be recovered over an initial mine life of eight years, with pre-production capital estimated at A$116-million. The mine is expected to produce some 105 000 oz/y, but has the potential to increase to 139 000 oz/y when the nearby Blue Spec deposit is developed.
