The board of Australia-listed Ionic Rare Earths has appointed Jill Kelley executive director to drive engagement with key stakeholders and potential end-users in the US. This is in keeping with the company’s strategy of increasing its presence in North America. Kelley has previously held roles at the highest levels of international leadership and has played a crucial role in supporting US military operations spanning over 60 countries, collectively known as the US Coalition Allies. Ionic says Kelley has met regularly with royals, Presidents, Prime Ministers and Parliamentarians to foster military, security and economic relationships, in her role as former honorary ambassador to US Central Command commander Jim Mattis and Central Intelligence Agency director David Petraeus. Additionally, as a former diplomat, Kelley was the youngest appointed Honorary Consul General to South Korea, with the title being bestowed upon her by the South Korean President for her ability to influence international security, trade and economic opportunities. “We believe that with her extensive experience globally and within strategic areas of US government and connections to key industries that require secure supply of critical commodities, Ionic has the potential to become a serious contender in providing end-users with rare earths critical to the development of offshore wind turbine green energy,” says chairperson Trevor Benson. The company is focused on developing its flagship Makuutu rare earths project, in Uganda, with a Phase 4 drilling programme under way since mid-June.
