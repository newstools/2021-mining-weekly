Law firms Mbuyisa Moleele and Leigh Day on July 5 said a key witness had come forward, as a class action lawsuit against diversified miner Anglo American in relation to alleged lead poisoning in Kabwe, Zambia, continues. The witness, Dr Ian Lawrence, was a doctor at the Kabwe mine from 1969 until the early 1970s. The law firms alleged that his statement sheds light on the extent to which Anglo knew about the dangers of lead poisoning in Kabwe as early as 1970, and said it counters the companyâ€™s argument that it bears no responsibility for the lead poisoning in the community. They stated that, according to his affidavit, the blood levels of staff were checked regularly and that mine management was aware of the risk of lead poisoning. Anglo has made a second extension request for filing its response to the class action and a hearing to decide on the extension is being held at the Gauteng division of the High Court of South Africa this week.
