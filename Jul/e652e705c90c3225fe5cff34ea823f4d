PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Firefinch on Tuesday reported that gold production during the June quarter had reached 12 555 oz at its Morila project, in Mali, with the mine delivering record output during the month of June. Gold production in the month of June reached a record 5 109 oz, representing a 21% increase on the previous highest monthly gold production since Firefinch acquired the gold project in late 2020. The miner told shareholders that production at Morila was now benefitting from the restart of mining operations at the satellite pits, and the successful refurbishment and recommisisoning of the comminution circuit. “These latest production figures clearly demonstrate the benefits of recommencing mining and processing of the satellite ores. We expect the positive trend in production to continue as we access Viper and enjoy a full quarter of operating the successfully recommissioned processing circuit,” said MD Michael Anderson. The production guidance for the upcoming quarter has been set at between 13 000 oz and 15 000 oz.
