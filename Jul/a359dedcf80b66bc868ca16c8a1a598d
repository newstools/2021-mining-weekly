PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner Newcrest Mining on Monday told shareholders that mining operations at its Cadia mine, in New South Wales, continued uninterrupted, despite a localized seismic event on Friday. The miner noted that no injuries were sustained, and all personnel working in the affected area were accounted for and safely returned to surface. Mining operations in all other areas apart from the eastern end of the Panel Cave 2, along with development activities and above-ground operations all continued apace. Inspections have been conducted and have confirmed that past investment in ground support has been effective in preventing damage to infrastructure, with only localized damage to the roadways and ground support near the junction of two extraction drives, and miner ground support damage to a nearby ventilation rise. The company told shareholders that it has been working with the New South Wales Resource Regulator and a prohibition notice has been established around the affected area only, with a geotechnical report to be sent to the Regulator for approval to start rehabilitation activities in the affected area. The localized seismic event is not expected to impact either gold or copper production from Cadia for the 2022 financial year, Newcrest said.
