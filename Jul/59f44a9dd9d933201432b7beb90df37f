Aim-listed Oriole Resource has appointed Claire Bay executive director of exploration and development, effective immediately. Bay is a chartered geologist with more than 13 years’ experience in the resources sector, including a decade at Stratex International. She had been promoted to Oriole’s exploration and development VP in July 2018 after the company was restructured and renamed Oriole. Oriole CEO Tim Livesey says that, with Bay’s deep technical knowledge and experience, as well as her detailed understanding of the company and the markets in which it trades, she brings key skills and knowledge to the board. “She has been a critical part of the recent refocusing of the company and will bring much value through this new appointment.” Oriole has a number of interests and royalties in companies operating throughout Africa and Turkey, in the gold and base metal sectors.
