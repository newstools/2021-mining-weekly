PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ ASX-listed Neometals has completed the review of 11 nickel mineral resource estimates at its Mt Edwards project, in Western Australia. The review was launched in mid-2019, and nine mineral resource estimates have been re-estimated between November 2019 and June 2021 using new and existing data. Mt Edwards is considered to host some 10.2-million tonnes of resource, grading 1.6% nickel for 162 560 t of contained nickel. Neometals last week announced plans to demerge the Mt Edwards nickel project into a dedicated nickel exploration and development company, to be called Widgie Nickel, which will likely list on the ASX.
