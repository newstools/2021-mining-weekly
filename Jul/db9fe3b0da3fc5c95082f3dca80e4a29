PERTH (miningweekly.com) – A review at lithium developer Galan Lithium’s Hombre Muerto West (HMW) project, in Argentina, has confirmed that the production rate could increase up to 25 000 t/y of lithium carbonate equivalent. Galan earlier this year said that it was looking at options of expanding production at the HMW project from the 20 000 t/y battery grade lithium carbonate equivalent evaluated in the project’s preliminary economic assessment. That assessment estimated that the project would require an initial capital investment of $439-million, which included a 30% contingency, with cash costs of production estimated at $3 518/t of lithium carbonate, with the mine life estimated at 40 years. Galan said on Monday that the company’s project team had now completed a preliminary evaporation pond design, with full use of tenement holdings to produce up to 25 000 t/y of lithium carbonate, confirming the robustness of the evaporation design to achieve a high quality brine concentrate by successfully completing two additional brine evaporation tests. In addition, a revised drilling programme was also reviewed, and contract discussions have begun with a view to start the drilling programme as soon as feasible. “Galan continues to strengthen and broaden the flexibility of the HMW project with a view to production as soon as possible. We have confirmed the existence of a strong product with lithium concentrate levels beyond 6% lithium, and we continue to optimise our evaporation route,” said MD Juan Pablo Vargas de la Vega. “Our team is confident of the HMW project’s potential to increase its production levels up to 25 000 t/y of lithium carbonate in the next feasibility studies. The Galan team continues to look at solutions to grow and make HMW as robust and as low risk as possible by using proven technology.”
