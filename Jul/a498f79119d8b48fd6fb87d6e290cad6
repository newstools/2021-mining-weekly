Morocco-focused potash development company Emmerson has appointed Rupert Joy a nonexecutive director, with immediate effect. He succeeds Edward McDermott, who has stepped down from the board. Joy is an experienced diplomat and former Ambassador and head of the European Union (EU) delegation to Morocco, and the company says his appointed is designed to further strengthen its national profile and networks as Emmerson advances towards the construction of Africa's first commercial potash mine. Joy has worked as an independent consultant for the past four years, providing support to UK government departments and private clients on issues relating to regional stability, investment, security and migration in North Africa. He speaks French and Arabic. "Rupert has extensive experience in one of the most senior European diplomatic posts as EU Ambassador to Morocco and we believe this will be highly valuable as we advance our Khemisset potash project to become the first commercial potash mine in Africa. “Our project is strategically located; not only is it in close proximity to both port and road infrastructure in a regional context, but Morocco is poised to become an integrated fertiliser production hub once Khemisset commences production. “Rupert's appointment comes at an exciting time in our corporate and operational development in Morocco and I look forward to working with him as we continue to build commercial partnerships across Morocco and the wider global markets,” Emmerson CEO Graham Clarke says. "I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Ed for the significant contribution he has made during his time as a nonexecutive director of Emmerson. “Ed has been with the company since incorporation and played a vital role in the transaction that brought the Khemisset project to the company. His industry knowledge and experience have been of real benefit to the board and we wish him well in his future endeavours,” he adds.
