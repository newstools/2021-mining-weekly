PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Western Australian Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) has given its backing for the development of the Mardie salt and potash project, subject to certain conditions. The EPA’s recommendations include 19 proposed conditions for the construction and operation of the Mardie project, which project developer BCI Minerals said was in line with the company’s design, costing and implementation plans for the project. “This positive environmental assessment represents four years of collaboration with the EPA and evidences our systematic approach to approvals and our willingness to engage with stakeholders,” said BCI MD Alwyn Vorster. “Mardie’s comprehensive environmental management plans will ensure the environmental values will be appropriately managed and protected. We are confident that the Mardie environmental review document, with associated EPA conditions, are aligned with environmental best practice and will meet the expectations of the Western Australian government.” The Western Australia Minister for the Environment would now consult with other departments within the state government before making a final decision on the project. The environmental approval for the Mardie project was one of the remaining milestones to a final investment decision, Vorster said. The Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility has previously agreed to provide a A$450-million loan to BCI for the development of the Mardie project, with first sales from the project expected by the third quarter of 2024, while first sulphate of potash (SoP) sales are expected by the fourth quarter of 2025. The A$913-million project is expected to produce some 5.35-million tonnes a year of salt and some 140 000 t/y SoP, over a projected mine life of at least 60 years.
