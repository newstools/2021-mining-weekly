PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The share price of junior Emmerson Resources surged on Monday following reports of a bonanza gold intercept at its first diamond drill hole at its Mauretania operation, in Tennant Creek.

Emmerson has reported results including 3.95 m at 57 g/t gold, 0.22% bismuth, 20.6 g/t silver and 0.23% copper from 207 m, including 1 m at 102 g/t gold, 47 g/t silver and 0.6% bismuth, and 0.8 m at 135 g/t gold, 40.2 g/t silver and 0.34% bismuth. Emmerson share prices surged to 7.5c each on Monday, up from a closing price of 6.7c each at the close of business on Friday. “This first drill intersection in the current programme demonstrates the unexplored potential beneath the known oxide- gold mineralisation at Mauretania. Previous drilling was focused on delineating the shallow mineralisation amenable to openpit mining, however, this bonanza intersection now greatly expands the potential for high-grade gold in the underlying primary zone,” said Emmerson MD Rob Bills. “Once all the assay results are received, further drilling will be planned to test for extensions of this primary mineralisation,” said Bills. Joint venture partner Tennant Consolidated Mining Group is fully funding the drill programme at Mauretania as part of its A$5.5-million earn-in over the northern project area at Tennant Creek.
