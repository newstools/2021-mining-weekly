Uranium miner Cameco on Sunday returned its regular workforce to the Cigar Lake mine, in northern Saskatchewan, saying that the risk posed by the nearby wildfire had subsided. About 230 workers were evacuated from the site on July 1, as a precaution owing to the proximity of a wildfire burning in the vicinity of the operation. “With improved weather and smoke conditions, minimal likelihood of further road closures in the area, and all infrastructure at Cigar Lake remaining intact, Cameco believes the full complement of personnel can be safely remobilised and regular operations resumed,” said Cameco. Production would restart later this week.
