PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Tomingley gold mine, in New South Wales, has exceeded production expectations for the 2021 financial year, owner Alkane Resources said on Thursday. The company had previously set a production guidance of between 50 000 oz and 55 000 oz for the Tomingley mine for the full year, however, the operation produced 56 958 oz during the 12 months under review. Preliminary all-in sustaining costs for the full year have been reported at A$1 320/oz which was below the guidance of between A$1 400/oz and A$1 550/oz for the same period. “Tomingley continues to meet or exceed our expectations, demonstrating why it is a great asset managed by a highly professional and committed operations team,” said Alkane MD Nic Earner. “With an updated mine plan that extends the life of Tomingley to at least 2031, at increased production rates, we remain buoyant about the longer-term prospects at both Tomingley and our Boda exploration tenements.” For the 2022 financial year, Alkane has set a production target of between 55 000 oz and 60 000 oz for Tomingley, at an all-in sustaining cost of between A$1 450/oz and A$1 600/oz.
