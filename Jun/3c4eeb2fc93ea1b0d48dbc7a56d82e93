Volkswagen’s CEO criticized Group of Seven (G7) leaders for failing to set a firm date to phase out coal power, saying it’s senseless to let electric vehicles run on dirty energy. “That’s not enough, @G7. Disappointing outcome,” VW CEO Herbert Diess tweeted Tuesday. “We need to exit coal much earlier! EVs are key to reach the climate goals 2030. But EVs only make sense with green energy, letting EVs run on coal is regulatory nonsense.” Diess, 62, is leading the most aggressive push into electric vehicles (EVs) by an established carmaker, with plans to launch roughly 70 battery-powered models by the end of the decade. He criticised Germany last year for being too slow and timid in its retreat from coal-fired power plants. In the final communique that emerged from last week’s summit, the G7 committed to ending international funding for carbon-intensive fossil fuel energy as soon as possible and speeding up their exit from coal as they decarbonise their electricity sectors in the 2030s. But they weren’t able to agree on a firmer date due to resistance from one group member.
