Coal mining company Seriti Power on June 18 handed over the 24-hour Rockdale community healthcare centre, in the Steve Tshwete local municipality, to the Mpumalanga Department of Health. The centre, which is already operational, was built at a cost of more than R34-million and forms part of Seriti’s social and labour plan commitments and its contribution towards local economic development in the area. The community healthcare centre provides acute, chronic and maternal and child health services. It has a fully equipped dental department and two living quarters to accommodate staff offering the 24-hour service to the community. The completion of the clinic was expedited to assist with the management of the Covid-19 pandemic within the community and beyond. The decision to invest in the construction of the clinic was taken after extensive participation in the Steve Tshwete local municipality’s Integrated Development Planning process, that ensures that projects sponsored by mining companies are linked to government’s development priorities.
