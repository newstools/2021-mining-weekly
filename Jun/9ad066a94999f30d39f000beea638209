PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner Gold Road Resources on Monday warned of lower production from its Gruyere joint venture in Western Australia, for the June quarter. The company told shareholders that owing to disruptions to the processing plant operations at Gruyere, the mine was expected to produce between 52 000 oz and 55 000 oz for the June quarter, compared with the 66 213 oz produced in the March quarter. As a result of the lower-than-expected gold production and additional plant maintenance, all-in sustaining costs for the June quarter will range between A$1 675/oz and A$1 800/oz, compared with the A$1 386/oz achieved in the March quarter. The miner said on Monday that gold production for the full 2021 would be at the lower-end of the previous guidance of between 260 000 oz and 300 000 oz, while all-in sustaining costs for the full year would reach between A$1 325/oz and A$1 475/oz. The disruptions to the processing plant operations included a torn mill feed conveyor belt, which resulted in temporary repairs and reduced processing rates while specialist personnel and materials for the belt replacement were obtained. Following the shutdown of the milling circuit to replace the conveyor belt, a coupling at the ball mill failed. As a result, processing at Gruyere continued at a reduced rate, with only the semi-autogenous grinding mill in operation. Repairs to the ball mill were completed at the tail end of last week, and the processing plant has now resumed full operations.
