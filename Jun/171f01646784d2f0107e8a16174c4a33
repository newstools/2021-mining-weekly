PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Diversified miner Rio Tinto has appointed former Western Australian Treasurer Ben Wyatt as a nonexecutive director, effective from September 2021. The miner said this week that Wyatt brought extensive public policy, regulatory and international trade experience to the board from his time as Treasurer and Aboriginal Affairs Minister in the Western Australian government. Before entering the State Parliament in 2006, Wyatt was a barrister and solicitor. “I am delighted to welcome Wyatt to the Rio Tinto board. With family links to the Pilbara and an impressive track record in public life, his knowledge of public policy, finance, international trade and Indigenous affairs will significantly add to the depth of knowledge on the board at a time when we are seeking to strengthen relationships with key stakeholders in Australia and around the world,” said Rio chairperson Simon Thompson. “I have deep respect for the resources sector in Australia and have long been impressed with the professionalism and commitment demonstrated by Rio Tinto. I was deeply saddened and disappointed by the events at Juukan Gorge but I am convinced that Rio Tinto is committed to changing its approach to cultural heritage issues and restoring its reputation, particularly in Australia and Western Australia. I am looking forward to working with the board in building on the momentum for change generated by the new leadership team,” Wyatt said. Wyatt was also recently appointed as a nonexecutive director to oil and gas major Woodside’s board of directors.
