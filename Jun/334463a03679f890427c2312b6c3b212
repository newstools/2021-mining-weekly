TSX-listed Osisko Miing has made a significant new high-grade gold discovery north of its Windfall gold project, in Eeyou Istchee James Bay, Québec. Reconnaissance drilling about 1 km north of Windfall identified the discovery area, dubbed Golden Bear, located along a sub-parallel splay of the Windfall Bank Fault. Discovery hole OSK-UB-21-232 intersected 6.7 m of 27.4 g/t gold. “It’s early days, but it looks like we’ve found another new high-grade system near Windfall in an area with little drilling.  We are very excited by the Golden Bear discovery, particularly as this new mineralisation is located less than a kilometre from the footprint of where we hope to build the Windfall mine and milling facility,” said CEO John Burzynski. “When Osisko discovered the Lynx deposit in 2016 it was a game-changer for the overall scale and grade of Windfall.  We believe that this new high-grade discovery may similarly have a significant positive effect on our development plans for the Windfall camp.  It certainly underscores the highly prospective nature of Osisko’s strategic land package surrounding Windfall, the vast majority of which has yet to see any drilling.”
