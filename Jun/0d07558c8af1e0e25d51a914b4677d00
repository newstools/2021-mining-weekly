PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Strike Resources has started the haulage of lump direct shipping ore (DSO) from its Apurimac iron-ore project, in Peru, to a stockpile area close to the Port of Pisco. The company is expected to ship its first 30 000 t of DSO product to customers in China, during July of this year, at an estimated free-on-board cost of between $70/t and $80/t. “The commencement of haulage of ore to a stockpile area near the Port of Pisco is another key milestone in the development of the company’s 100%-owned high-grade Apurimac iron-ore project,” said Strike MD William Johnson. “With first shipment targeted for July, Strike is now focused on building its local infrastructure in Peru to support an annualised production rate of 250 000 t/y in the near term. “Furthermore, the study being undertaken by Ausenco on the 2008 Apurimac project prefeasibility study is advancing well with the objective of outlining the world-class potential of a large-scale iron-ore mine from the company’s concession in Peru.” Some 50 000 t of high-grade DSO has been mined at Apurimac to date, with Strike targeting annual sales of some 250 000 t/y from the project.
