Vancouver-headquartered Ero Copper has received approval from the NYSE for a US listing of common shares. Trading will start on June 15, the company said in a statement on Thursday, adding that its shares will continue to trade on the TSX. “We believe this US listing is an important milestone for our company as it provides another access point for investors seeking to invest in Ero,” said executive chairperson Noel Dunn. “Since our IPO in 2017, our business and assets have achieved tremendous growth, garnering increased attention from global investors. We believe that listing on the NYSE offers an opportunity to broaden our shareholder base and enhance trading liquidity for existing shareholders.” Concurrent with the commencement of trading on the NYSE, Ero Copper’s common shares will cease trading on the OTC Markets. Ero is focused on copper production from the Vale do Curaçá property, in Bahia, Brazil.
