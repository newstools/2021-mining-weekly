Mining activities are under way at the Santa Luz gold mine, in Brazil, preparing for the first gold pour in the first quarter of 2022, Toronto-listed Equinox Gold reported on Tuesday. The mine will produce 110 000 oz/y for the first five years of operations. Equinox said that the mining contractor, U&M Mineração e Construção (U&M), mobilised to site in May and mining started in mid-June. Mining activities are currently focused on removing waste from two locations and developing access roads, ramps, dumps and ore storage areas in preparation for a pre-stripping campaign prior to mining ore in late 2021. To make room for mine expansion, U&M is also relocating an existing ore stockpile with an average grade of 0.9 g/t gold, which will be used for commissioning activities in the fourth quarter. As a brownfield past-producing mine, the majority of site services and infrastructure is already in place at Santa Luz.
