David Clarry, VP of corporate social responsibility (CSR) for Hudbay Minerals, has been elected chairperson of the Mining Association of Canada (MAC) for the next two years. Clarry comes to his new role with extensive experience in the mining sector, and significant familiarity with MAC having been a dedicated participant on multiple committees, including the executive, international social responsibility, and indigenous relations committees, over the past several years. "We are pleased to have David assume the leadership position at MAC," said president and CEO Pierre Gratton. "As a CSR leader in our sector, David is well versed on many of the issues affecting our industry today, including climate change, corporate responsibility, Indigenous collaboration and responsible business practices abroad. We are particularly pleased to have him as chair given his familiarity with MAC's Towards Sustainable Mining initiative, our commitment to sustainable mining, and know he will provide important input to the work we do." Effective Wednesday, Clarry replaces Iamgold CEO Gordon Stothart, who served as chairperson from June 2019 to June 2021. "It was a privilege to have Gordon at the helm over the past two years," continued Gratton. "Throughout the pandemic, Gordon provided a steady hand during a time of much uncertainty and we appreciate all he did to ensure Canada's mining industry was positioned for success in the face of Covid-19."
