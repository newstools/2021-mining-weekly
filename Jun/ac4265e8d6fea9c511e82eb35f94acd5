The board of rare earth developer Ionic Rare Earths Limited (IonicRE) has awarded Melbourne-based Mincore the engineering manager role for the completion of a feasibility study for its 51%-owned Makuutu rare earths project, in Uganda. IonicRE has started the study and will now work closely with Mincore to complete the process plant and associated nonprocess infrastructure for Makuutu. Mincore will work with the IonicRE owner’s team to compile the feasibility study report, which will be submitted to the Ugandan Directorate of Geological Survey and Mines as part of the company’s submission for a mining licence application by October 2022.

Mincore will initially complete a review of the project, including looking for opportunities for capital expenditure (capex) optimisation. Mincore’s appointment for the feasibility study phase followed a competitive tender process, to select a contractor with suitable experience and capabilities to complete the engineering design as well as the subsequent oversight on the completion of the feasibility study.

Commenting on the engagement of Mincore, IonicRE MD Tim Harrison says the company has made significant progress over the past few months, ensuring the optimal team is in place and that work programmes are now under way to meet accelerated timelines. “This next six months will see a continued increase in activity, highlighted by the current drill programme, which will greatly enhance the project’s resource definition, key to unlocking a robust feasibility study over the next 12 to 18 months.”
