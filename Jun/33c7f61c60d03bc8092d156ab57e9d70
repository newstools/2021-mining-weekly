PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Ore processing has started at the Karalwinda gold project, in Western Australia, following the completion of construction. ASX-listed Capricorn Metals on Thursday told shareholders that the construction activities had been completed to plan over the last three weeks, culminating in the ball mill and crushing circuit being ready for full operation in the last week. “The commencement of continuous ore processing at the Karlawinda gold project is a significant milestone for Capricorn. It is the culmination of a huge effort from our construction team and key contractors,” said executive chairperson Mark Clark. “We now look forward to transitioning to full steady-state operations and turning the project into a profitable, long-life business.” The A$132-million Karlawinda was initially expected to produce 660 955 oz over an eight-and-a-half-year mine life.
