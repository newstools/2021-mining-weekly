PERTH (miningweekly.com) – First ore has been mined from the Tampia gold project, in Western Australia, ASX-listed Ramelius Resources reported on Thursday. The mining of first ore at Tampia followed the start of openpit mining in late April this year, with the first ore mined from the North pit. Mining is expected to move to the higher-grade Mace and South pit areas in line with the planned mining schedule. Ramelius told shareholders that Tampia remained on time and within budget to dispatch the first road train of high-grade ore to the Edna May processing facility in early July. “We are pleased to have commenced the mining of high-grade ore from our Tampia gold mine on schedule with our published mine plan. This is the culmination of the efforts of many employees, contractors, members of the local community and the shires of Narembeen, Merredin and Westonia,” said Ramelius MD Mark Zeptner. “Gold from Tampia will represent a significant proportion of our 2022 production target and will be our first new mine in the Western Australian wheatbelt, where we believe we will deliver significant returns for all stakeholders.” The A$26.4-million project is expected to produce some 186 000 oz of gold.
