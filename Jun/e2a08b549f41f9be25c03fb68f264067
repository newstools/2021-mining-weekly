TSX-V-listed Diamcor Mining has so far sold 4 468 ct for the quarter to end June 30, generating revenue of $1.2-million. About 1 500 additional carats, including several rough diamonds in the +10.8 ct specials category, have been delivered as of June 15. CEO Dean Taylor says the results from ongoing tender and sales activity continue to demonstrate the company’s ability to achieve strong dollar per carat averages – at about $270/ct – and to generate significant gross revenues, while processing material at lower volumes owing to Covid-19-related considerations. The company recovers rough diamonds from processing of quarry material at the Krone Endora at Venetia project, in South Africa’s Limpopo province.
