ASX-, Aim- and JSE-listed potash development company Kore Potash has appointed Jean-Michel Bour as CFO. Bour will report directly to CEO Brad Sampson and is not joining the company’s board. “The company is in a strong position to realise its potential in developing the world class Sintoukola potash basin and Jean-Michel’s experience in the sector will prove of great benefit to Kore as we move through the next stages of growth towards financing and production. "I would also like to thank Andrey Maruta for his contribution to the company during his time as our CFO,” Kore CEO Brad Sampson says. Maruta will step down as CFO, effective June 10, to pursue other opportunities. He has a Bachelor’s degree in business studies with over 21 years’ experience in the mining and oil and gas sectors. This includes a long period at BHP where he held several management and leadership roles, notably as business controller for the nickel and copper businesses and head of risk for global functions. Bour previously worked as a consultant for Rio Tinto, designing and rolling out a risk management improvement project for its global treasury. He has consulted for Anglo American. Kore is focused on bringing its potash projects in Congo-Brazzaville into production.
