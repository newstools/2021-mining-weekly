PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Great Boulder Resources has assumed full ownership of the gold project, in Western Australia, after continued exploration spend at the site. The Yamarna asset was joint ventured (JV) between Great Boulder and privately held Eastern Goldfields Mining Company (EGMC), which held a 25% interest in the JV. EGMC’s interest in the project has diluted owing to Great Boulder’s ongoing expenditure at the project, with Great Boulder now electing to convert EGMC’s remaining interest in the project to a 2% net smelter royalty, simplifying the ownership of the project. “This is a great result for shareholders, consolidating 100% of Yamarna as we move forward,” said Great Boulder MD Andrew Paterson. “We are now reviewing all options to move the project forward in a way that will reward our shareholders and provide exposure to future upside at Yamarna.” The Yamarna project consists of eight granted tenements across two projects, covering some 358 km2 of tenure.
