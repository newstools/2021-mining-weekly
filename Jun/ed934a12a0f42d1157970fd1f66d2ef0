Magnet metal and rare earths miner Pensana is supporting business promotion platform Humber Business Week to boost its Saltend rare earths facility. Pensana says the facility will be transformational in bringing back high-value manufacturing jobs and creating a sustainable UK supply chain for the electric vehicle and offshore wind sectors. As such, Pensana chairperson Paul Atherley, on June 7, joined Associated British Ports, KPMG, Able UK and Marketing Humber to discuss Pensana’s role in the Humber freeport, which is set to boost the local economy by £3.5-billion in investment and generate 7 000 “high-quality” new jobs, according to the company. Also, Pensana CEO Tim George will, on June 9, join Humber officials from the HEY Local Enterprise Partnership to present the £100-million inward investment Pensana’s Saltend project represents. Pensana, in a statement, says the company looks forward to engaging with local stakeholders and discussing how Pensana has rapidly moved its important investment at Saltend through site selection, project approvals and early works in just six months. The London-listed company is investing in building a sustainable rare earth separation facility in the Saltend Chemicals Park, in Humber, in the UK. The facility will source its raw materials from Pensana’s Longonjo mine, in Angola. Pensana expects to produce about 12 500 t/y of rare earth oxide, including 4 500 t/y of magnet metal rare earth oxides.
