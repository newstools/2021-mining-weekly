Dual-listed Danakali’s Colluli Mining Share Company (CMSC) has completed its test work for the Colluli sulphate of potash (SoP) project, in Eritrea, and optimised its process design using filtered seawater, significantly reducing capital expenditure, operating expenditure and maintenance costs. The results prove that Colluli ore will produce predictable high-grade SoP at the stated 472 000 t/y from modules 1 and 2. The test results are the outcome of six months of diligent detailed test work conducted in collaboration with industry experts the Saskatchewan Research Council, Global Potash Solutions, DRA Global and CasCan, Danakali reports. It notes that it worked closely with its offtake partners, EuroChem, to ensure spec-grade, high-quality SoP was produced in line with international standards. The test work builds on the previous front-end engineering and design study and positions CMSC process design as a ‘world first’ using filtered seawater, column floatation and co-processing of carnalitite and sylvinitite ore, which significantly reduces project development, operational, finance and market risk.
