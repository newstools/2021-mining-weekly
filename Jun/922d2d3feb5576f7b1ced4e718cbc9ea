Canadian miner Kinross Gold has suspended mill operations at its Tasiast mine, in Mauritania, following a fire at the mine on Tuesday. No one was injured in the fire. Kinross said on Wednesday that it was investigating the cause of the fire and that it was assessing the damage and potential impact on the operation. The group’s previously announced guidance for 2021 is 2.4-million gold-equivalent ounces (GEO) at an all-in sustaining cost of $1 025/GEO. Tasiast produced 103 837 GEOs in the March 2021 quarter. Tasiast is one of Kinross’ three biggest producing mines. The mine is being expanded and the company said last month that the 24k project remained on budget and schedule to increase throughput capacity to 21 000 t/d by the end of the year, and 24 000 t/d by mid-2023.
