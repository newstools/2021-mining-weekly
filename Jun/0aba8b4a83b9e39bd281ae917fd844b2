London-listed Emmerson says the environmental approval process for its Khemisset potash project, in Morocco, is progressing well, with all technical work having been completed and submitted. The company expects final approval from the country’s Environmental Evaluation Committee imminently. In the meantime, Emmerson has also lodged applications for the renewal of remaining research permits that were not part of the mining licence area, with a positive outcome on these expected during the third quarter this year. The company has started a tender process for technical field works, with the aim of addressing risks determined in the feasibility study of the project, as well as preparing data for use in the engineering design workstreams. Emmerson’s workstreams are on course for early construction works to start by the end of the year, including debt funding due diligence.
