Metals miner Nornickel has resumed ore mining at the Taimyrsky underground mine, which was flooded earlier this year. The world’s top producer of palladium said on Friday that the mine was currently operating at 5 000 t/d, which was about 40% of the design capacity. "Water from the horizons of the Taimyrsky mine has been pumped out. Today, our main goal is to reinforce the underground workings to ensure the safety of our employees. We will be gradually scaling up mining as we take these measures. The mine is expected to reach its design capacity of 12 100 t/d by the end of June 2021," said senior VP and head of the Norilsk division Nikolay Utkin. The final stage of recovery operations at the Taimyrsky mine, of 4.3-million tonnes a year of ore, would be fully completed by the end of the month. The Oktyabrsky mine, which also flooded earlier, resumed full operations in May.
