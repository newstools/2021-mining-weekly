Canadian miner Alamos Gold on Tuesday reported new results from surface and underground exploration drilling at the Island Gold mine, further extending high-grade mineralisation in Island East and West. At Island East, high-grade mineralisation extended 20 m from the nearest inferred resource block, over significant widths. This included the best hole drilled to date, MH25-08, which intersected 71.21 g/t (39.24 g/t cut) over 21.33. This hole is 45 m down-plunge from the previous best surface directional hole MH25-04, which intersected 28.97 g/t gold (27.96 g/t cut) over 21.76 m. MH25-08 and the previously reported MH25-04 have true widths about four times greater than the average width of the large high-grade inferred resource block up-plunge, said Alamos. Another new hole in Island East is MH25-07, which intersected 34.87 g/t gold (34.87 g/t cut) over 5.98 m. Underground directional drilling at Island West extended high-grade mineralisation 50 m below the nearest inferred resource block and partially closed the 185 m gap between high-grade resource blocks. New highlights include 31.58 g/t (28.74 g/t cut) over 2.43 m. “Over the past year, ongoing exploration success has driven another one-million ounce increase in mineral reserves and resources at Island Gold and returned the two best intersections to date. We expect these new results to drive further mineral resource growth in one of the highest grade portions of the orebody. This already large mineral resource block in Island East is in proximity to the planned shaft and remains open laterally and down-plunge demonstrating further significant upside to the Phase 3 expansion,” said president and CEO John McCluskey. A total of $25-million is budgeted in 2021 for surface and underground exploration at Island Gold, up from $13-million spent in 2020.
