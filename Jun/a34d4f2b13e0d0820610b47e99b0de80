PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Coal miner Whitehaven Coal has lowered its run-of-mine (RoM) production expectations for the full 2021 financial year, on the back of planned downtime at its Narrabri mine, in New South Wales. Full year RoM production is now expected to reach 20.4-million tonnes, down from the previous estimate of between 20.6-million and 21.4-million tonnes. Production at Narrabri is expected to reach 4.1-million tonnes during the full year, while the Maules Creek operation is likely to contribute 12.5-million tonnes, and the Gunnedah opencuts to contribute a further 3.8-million tonnes. Managed coal sales guidance has declined from the previous 17.8-million to 18.3-million target, to 17.9-million tonnes, while unit costs are expected to reach A$74/t. Whitehaven told shareholders that the RoM production was adjusted to take into account the downtime associated with the acceleration of engineering works at Narrabri to support the longwall operation, as well as a recent geological event. Overhaul works on the longwall and machinery repairs will be completed in the coming days.
