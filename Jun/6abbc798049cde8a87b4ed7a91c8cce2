PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner Red 5 on Friday said that first production from its King of the Hills mine, in Western Australia, was on schedule for the June quarter 2022, with the project remaining within budget. The ASX-listed company has received power station works approval from the Department of Environment and Water Regulation, ahead of the scheduled start of construction of the power station. “We are continuing to complete the permitting, development and construction milestones at King of the Hills, with solid progress being made since our last update in early May,” said Red 5 MD Mark Williams. “On the permitting front, we received our construction permit for the power station well in advance of the scheduled start of construction. The King of the Hills village is now fully operational and has been accommodating the construction workforce for a number of months. “Construction activities continue to advance, gaining good momentum, with the construction of the carbon-in-leach tanks for the processing circuit rapidly advancing.” The initial mine plan for King of the Hills estimated a mine life of 16 years, with gold production in years one to six expected to average 176 000 oz/y, while peak annual gold production of 203 000 oz/y will be achieved in 2024, benefitting from underground mining of one-million tonnes a year in years one to four.
