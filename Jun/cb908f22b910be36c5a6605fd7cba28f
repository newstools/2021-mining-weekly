Nevada-focused i-80 Gold has renamed its Getchell property to Granite Creek to avoid confusion with the Getchell openpit at the nearby Turquoise Ridge mine, the company said on Wednesday. The firm also reported that it had kicked off the 2021 surface and underground drilling programme, which would consist of 22 000 m of drilling. "Advancing the Granite Creek mine project to producer status is the company's primary focus for 2021. The large-scale drilling programme is designed to increase resources, advance permitting to facilitate openpit mining, and prepare for test mining ahead of feasibility studies,” said president and CEO Matt Gili. The Granite Creek project is strategically located proximal to Nevada Gold Mines' Twin Creeks and Turquoise Ridge mines at the north end of the Battle Mountain-Eureka Trend at its intersection with the Getchell gold belt in Nevada.
