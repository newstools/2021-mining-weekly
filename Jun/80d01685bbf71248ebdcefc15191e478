PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Lithium junior Prospect Resources has started production at its Arcadia pilot plant, in Zimbabwe. Prospect told shareholders on Friday that the company was now focused on using the high purity petalite samples produced from the pilot plant, and the spodumene samples produced in a partner laboratory, to achieve final production qualifications with customers. “We have successfully demonstrated our capability to deliver this project in Zimbabwe. We now look forward to delivering high purity lithium products to the downstream supply chain to complete respective production qualification processes,” said Prospect MD Sam Hosack. “The development and operation of the pilot plant allows us to substantially reduce metallurgical risk for Arcadia, while demonstrating our ability to successfully operate in our jurisdiction, delivering increased confidence in the outcomes of existing technical study work and projected economics. “While lithium demand forecasts continue to be revised upwards, the supply base is falling further behind. Having secured all requisite development approvals, completed a definitive feasibility study, and now producing high purity lithium samples, Arcadia is one of the very few shovel-ready lithium projects globally,” said Hosack. The 2.4-million-tonne-a-year project would require a capital investment of $162-million, and would have a mine life of 15.5 years.
