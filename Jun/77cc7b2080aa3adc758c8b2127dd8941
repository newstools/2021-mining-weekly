State-owned power utility Eskom has announced that load-shedding will be suspended from 12:00 to 17:00 on June 4, to allow Parliament to pass a series of Appropriation Bills. The Deputy Speaker of Parliament requested that the utility suspend power cuts during this timeframe, as passing these Bills is essential to keeping government operating. Eskom explains that, without the relevant appropriations, there will be no funding for key State functions, including hospitals, law enforcement and other essential services. The suspension of load-shedding has been enabled by large industrial power consumers in South Africa agreeing to reduce their consumption during this period. Eskom will also use some emergency reserves during the timeframe. However, to again replenish the emergency reserves and prepare for the week ahead, Eskom has advised that Stage 2 load-shedding will resume from 17:00 on Friday and continue until late on Sunday, June 6.
