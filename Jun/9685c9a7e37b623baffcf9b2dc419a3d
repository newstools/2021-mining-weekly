London-listed explorer Red Rock Resources has started a 2Â 000 m reverse circulation drill programme to delineate a resource on the Luanshimba copper/cobalt project, in the Haut-Katanga province of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Samples from 20 or more holes of drilling will be sent for assaying in South Africa. The drill programme is being carried out by Rubaco, with geological support from Minerals Exploration Associates. Red Rock chairperson Andrew Bell says the company is optimistic about the potential of this site and, given the exploration results to date, it has designed the initial drill programme to test for a shallow-depth mineralised zone. Some of the initial results are suggestive of a system that extends to greater depths, which may require additional testing in a follow-up programme, he points out. This is the first project in the country that Red Rock has taken from a greenfield prospect to drilling. Red Rock owns 80% of the Luanshimba project and collected 70 km of magnetic data in December 2020 through ground surveying. This was followed by an induced polarisation and resistivity programme across three target areas.
