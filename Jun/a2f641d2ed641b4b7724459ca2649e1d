The Dundas ilmenite project, in Greenland, has received its final government-level approval required before construction can start, with the approval of its exploitation and closure plan. The government in December awarded an exploitation licence for the project, which London-listed Bluejay Mining is developing. “The permit covering the Dundas ilmenite project's exploitation and closure plan is the final government approval required to enable the commencement of construction. Following the receipt of our approved exploitation licence, we continue to finalise the optimisation planning and engineering sign-off, together with advancing discussions with partners to form a strong project financing syndicate,” Bluejay CEO Bo Møller Stensgaard said on Thursday. The government has remained supportive of the Dundas project throughout the recent elections in Greenland, which cast doubt on the future development of the Kvanefjeld rare earths mine proposed by Australia’s Greenland Minerals. Greenland Mineral Resources Minister Naaja Nathanielsen said in the Bluejay statement that the Dundas project provided new opportunities for the local community and marked a steppingstone for the mining industry. “We look forward to the continued cooperation with Bluejay Mining and Dundas Titanium on this and their other projects in Greenland.”
