PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Queensland government has said that exploration would continue to play a vital role in supporting jobs across the state, and would form a key part of the state’s economic recovery plan from Covid-19. In its last state Budget, the Queensland government has set aside nearly A$5-million in investment to help strengthen the resources exploration sector. “We know that supporting the exploration industry is important for finding new deposits and developing new projects. In turn, more projects mean more royalties, exports and more jobs for Queenslanders,” Resources Minister Scott Stewart said. “That is why we are backing the sector with a range of grants and opportunities for explorers. We will do this with A$2.5-million towards Collaborative Exploration Initiative grants and a further A$2.2-million to help with the development and expansion of the New Economy Minerals industry in Queensland. The state government has invested more than A$6.8-million in exploration grants and programmes since 2017. Stewart said the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data showed exploration expenditure continued to grow significantly. “According to the latest ABS statistics, investment in Queensland exploration has increased by an impressive 22.5% to A$705-million in 12 months,” he said. “Queensland’s boost in exploration expenditure has come from strong growth in exploration for minerals, up 14.5%, and oil and gas, up 53.1%, compared to the previous 12 months. “Building on this, last year alone the government released a total of 8 205 km2 for gas exploration to maintain a pipeline of future resources projects. Backing the resources sector is a key part of Queensland’s economic recovery from the Covid-19 global pandemic.”
