Marine phosphate miner Namibia Marine Phosphate (NMP) reports that the handing down of the judgment in a court case challenging the legitimacy of its Sandpiper mining licence (ML170) has been postponed to June 30. The court application was launched by the Confederation of Namibian Fishing Associations and three other parties. NMP states that the reason offered to it by the courts for the latest postponement is that judgment is not ready owing to Covid-19 implications. An initial hearing was held in July 2020 and the court case has since been postponed from March 8, to April 12 and then June 16. In a statement, NMP says it has full confidence in the Namibian legal system and that the company remains confident of a positive outcome.
