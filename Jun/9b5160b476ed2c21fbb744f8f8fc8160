West Africa-focused gold miner Endeavour Mining started trading on the LSE main market on Monday and is now the largest pure gold producer on the premium segment of the London market. “Over the past few years, we have built a resilient business, with a high-quality asset base made up of low cost, long-mine-life assets, attractive development projects and additional exploration potential. This underpins our attractive shareholder returns policy that we believe will create value for investors across the cycle,” said president and CEO Sebastien de Montessus. Endeavour’s entire issued ordinary share capital, consisting of 250 491 755 shares, was admitted to the premium listing segment of the official list of the Financial Conduct Authority and to trading on the LSE main market. Shares will trade on both the LSE and the TSX under the ticker symbol “EDV”. Endeavour is not intending to raise capital in conjunction with its London listing.
