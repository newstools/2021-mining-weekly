PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Chamber of Minerals and Energy (CME) of Western Australia has pledged the support of its member companies to families and communities affected by the fires in the Perth region. CEM CEO Paul Everingham on Thursday announced the coordination of a CME Bushfire Community Support Initiative, which would directly support response, relief and recovery efforts for those impacted by the Perth Hills fires. “The images of the devastation caused by these bushfires have had a profound impact on anyone who has seen them, in an area well known to the wider community,” Everingham said. “People have lost their homes, livestock and pets, along with priceless memories. Others have been displaced and don’t know when they will be able to return home. “A significant number of workers at CME member companies have been impacted by these fires and many others will have friends and families who have been affected.” Everingham said that member companies have committed around A$2.5-million in support funding so far. “We know we can’t replace what many of those people have lost but hopefully we can make things a little easier for them in the days, weeks and months to come.” Chevron Australia, Minara Resources, Mt Gibson Iron Ore, Newmont Australia and Rio Tinto have already committed to making significant donations and it is expected that a wide range of CME member companies will also contribute.
