PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Potash developer American Pacific has appointed Oklahoma-based Matrix Services Company to complete construction of Phase 1 A of its Fort Cady borate mine, in Southern California. The company on Tuesday noted that initial borate production from the Fort Cady project remained on track for the third quarter of this year. “We are delighted with the appointment of Matrix to complete the construction of Phase 1 A of our Fort Cady borate mine. Matrix is a leading North American industrial engineering and constructor contractor headquartered in Tulsa,” said American Pacific CEO and MD Mike Schlumpberger. “Matrix’s core values of safety and community involvement align perfectly with American Pacific’s core values and intention to ensure the mine is delivered safely and with positive community involvement. “This is another important step in the fulfillment of our aspiration to become a globally significant producer of borates and specialty fertilisers.” The starter project would target a production rate of 40 000 t/y sulphate of potash (SoP) and 9 000 t/y of boric acid, increasing to 90 000 t/y SoP and 80 000 t/y boric acid during Phase 1B. The Phase 2 project would ultimately increase production to 109 000 t/y SoP and 408 000 t/y boric acid, while the Phase 3 development would push production to 400 000 t/y of SoP and 450 000 t/y of boric acid.
