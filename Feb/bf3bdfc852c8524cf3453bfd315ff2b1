Brazilian major Vale has acquired a minority stake in Boston Metal to promote the development of technology focused on steel decarbonisation. Boston Metal is a pre-operating company, founded in 2012 by professors from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, whose objective is the development of aÂ technology called molten oxide electrolysis (MOE), which reduces metal oxides such as iron-ore with the use of electricity. This MOE process will enable the reduction of iron-ore to produce steel with zero carbon-dioxide emissions. The amounts raised by Boston Metal will be used to finance the development of the technology. Vale invested $6-million. Vale notes that it is committed to leading the transition to net-zero carbon mining and fostering a portfolio of high-quality products and innovative technologies to provide scope 3 solutions.
