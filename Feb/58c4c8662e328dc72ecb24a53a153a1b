The Aluchemie anode production facility, in Netherlands, will be closed at the end of the year, partners Rio Tinto and Hydro announced on Tuesday, citing its weak competitive position and challenging market conditions. The plant, opened in the mid-1960s, employs 220 employees and produces 216 000 t/y of anodes,  having previously discontinued operating four out of seven anode baking furnaces. Rio Tinto aluminium CEO Alf Barrios said that the investments required to continue operating Aluchemie were not viable. “We recognise this will impact employees and the community, and our focus now will turn to supporting the team at Aluchemie as they work with stakeholders to plan a safe and responsible closure.” Anodes are high-grade blocks of carbon, used in aluminium manufacturing (smelting).
