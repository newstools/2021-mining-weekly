Coal miner MC Mining has appointed nonexecutive director Sam Randazzo as its interim CEO while the recruitment process for the appointment of a permanent CEO is being finalised. Randazzo will succeed acting CEO Brenda Berlin, who is due to step down on February 15. MC says the recruitment process for a new CEO is at an advanced stage. Berlin has worked closely with Randazzo, facilitating an orderly handover and her departure is not expected to impact the finalisation of the funding for the company’s flagship, fully-permitted Makhado hard coking coal project. Her departure is also not expected to impact on the day-to-day running of the group’s operating mine – the Uitkomst colliery. Randazzo is chairperson of MC Mining’s audit and risk committee and a member of the nomination and remuneration committee. He is also a member of Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand. He has over 25 years’ experience in the mining industry and has completed numerous capital raisings, as well as having extensive public company exposure and operational management experience across a variety of projects in Africa and globally. This includes roles as CEO, CFO, chairperson and directorships of ASX-, TSX- and Aim-listed mineral resource companies. MC chairperson Bernard Pryor, on behalf of the board, thanks Randazzo for agreeing to serve as interim CEO. “[Randazzo] brings a wealth of mining, commercial and financing expertise that will be valuable to the company as we complete the Makhado Phase 1 funding.”
