The Minerals Council South Africa last year announced plans to undertake a series of surveys to better understand the progression of Covid-19 in local mining operations and it has recently received the results of the first phase of seroprevalence surveys. The results show that the number of individuals with antibodies to Covid-19 was 21%. The surveys were conducted by two large companies towards the end of 2020. Minerals Council health head Dr Thuthula Balfour on February 4 said the council planned to conduct two more rounds of surveys to add to the body of knowledge available on the disease. To date, the South African mining industry, which comprises 471 962 individuals, has experienced 27 943 positive cases of Covid-19, with 1 193 currently being active. The council also reports that, to date, Covid-19 has resulted in the death of 301 people in the mining industry, while 26 449 of those who tested positive having recovered thus far. Also, the mining industry, which has developed significant Covid-19 testing capability, has thus far undertaken 106 744 tests. In terms of testing against population numbers, the mining industry has achieved a 22.62% testing rate, which compares against a South African average of 14.01% and a global average of 18.76%. Of the total deaths, patients with one or more comorbidity accounted for 82.1%. Within the industry, the platinum sector has thus far accounted for the most cases and deaths, at 10 687 and 115 respectively. Balfour said this was because this sector was the largest employer in the mining industry. The gold sector has accounted for 5 601 cases and 98 deaths, while coal accounted for 5 522 cases and 40 deaths. All other commodities accounted for 6 133 cases and 48 deaths. In terms of vaccinating mining employees, the Minerals Council is working with its members on an awareness campaign to dispel myths and encourage employees to get the vaccine once it becomes available. Balfour also hinted that some miners, such as coal miners that produce coal for Eskom’s power stations, might be prioritised in the second phase of vaccines roll-out (after healthcare workers have all received vaccinations) as those workers were deemed essential during the Alert Level 5 restrictions and under the disaster management regulations.
