Precious metals miner Sibanye-Stillwater has achieved an ‘A-’ rating by nonprofit global environmental disclosure platform CDP, in recognition of its climate change action and disclosure. Sibanye has achieved ‘Leadership’ level ratings for six consecutive years for its carbon and climate change disclosures, and its 2020 rating is higher than the average rating of ‘C’ in the “Metallic mineral mining” group, the average rating of ‘C’ in Africa and the average rating of ‘C’ globally, Sibanye-Stillwater notes. Moreover, it mentions that Sibanye is in the top 11% of global companies in its group classification that reached ‘Leadership level’ with a score of ‘A-‘. About 9 500 companies participated during the most recent CDP Climate Change disclosure process. CDP’s yearly environmental disclosure and scoring process is widely recognised as the gold standard of corporate environmental transparency, supported by substantial investors globally who requested companies to disclose data on environmental impacts, risks and opportunities through CDP’s platform, posits Sibanye. Moreover, CDP scoring drives corporate transparency and helps to guide, incentivise and assess environmental action, the company says. Sibanye also intends to participate in the parallel CDP ‘Water security’ disclosure category going forward. “We are very pleased about the continuous recognition from the CDP for our climate change actions and disclosures and we are committed to further intensifying our effort as we work towards carbon neutrality. "Our platinum group metals play a critical role in removing noxious gasses from exhaust fumes and will play a fundamental role in the future hydrogen economy,” says Sibanye CEO Neal Froneman.
