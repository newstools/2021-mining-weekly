PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Alicanto Minerals has secured tenure over the historic Sala silver mine, in Sweden. The project, which was once Europe’s largest silver producer, is some 100 km from Alicanto’s existing Greater Falun copper/gold project. Sala ceased production in 1962, having produced more than 200-million ounces of silver at an estimated grade of 1 244 g/t gold. Alicanto MD Peter George said the Greater Falun project, and now the Sala silver project, was an outstanding opportunity, which would have been explored many years ago had the geology been better understood, and had it not been held in part by companies that were focused on other projects. “The presence of extensive high-grade copper/gold mineralisation with by-products of silver, zinc and lead at Falun has been well established through both mining and exploration. However, the full potential in the Greater Falun area has yet to be unlocked. “To now have Sala in our suite of projects is a significant addition to our portfolio within the Bergslagen area.” Alicanto will be starting an expanded and fully funded drilling programme at the Greater Falun project starting in February, and will begin drilling at Sala as soon as drilling permits have been approved as part of the process to independently verify previous drilling results.
