Glencore and Century Aluminum Company have finalised the sale of 150 000 t of Natur‐Al aluminium over five years to Austrian firm Hammerer Aluminium Industries (HAI). Natur‐Al products are made with energy from 100% renewable sources at Century’s Norðurál Grundartangi aluminum plant in Iceland, which was officially inaugurated in 2020. The aluminium will be supplied to Hammerer by Glencore. Natur‐Al aluminium has direct carbon dioxide  (CO₂) levels below 2 t of CO₂ per tonne of aluminium – one of the lowest CO₂ footprints in the world for the metal. The total CO₂ footprint is 4 t per 1 t of aluminium, less than one‐quarter of the industry average. To achieve these levels, Glencore explained in a statement on February 4 that it requires strict adherence to the highest standards in the sourcing of bauxite and alumina, the exclusive use of green energy from hydroelectric and geothermal sources and seamless operation of the production process. Glencore alumina and aluminium head Robin Scheiner said the key element in the company’s ambition is to be net zero by 2050. HAI CEO Rob van Gils, meanwhile, said the supply agreement underlines the company’s ambition to “contribute to a better future and that aluminium is part of the solution for the ambitions of the European Union Green Deal”.
