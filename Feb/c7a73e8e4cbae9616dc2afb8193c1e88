PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Northern Territory government has opened Round 14 of its exploration drilling and geophysics grants. This program, which is part of the A$26-million Resourcing the Territory initiative, is the biggest investment by any territory government into programs to attract and support resources exploration in the territory. Round 14 sees the funding criteria expanded to include drilling in brownfield areas, as recommended by the Territory Economic Reconstruction Commission. The program provides co-funding assistance of 50% of the program cost, up to A$125 000. “The minerals industry directly supports 4 400 ongoing Territory jobs and is one of the highest contributors to our economy, with mineral production worth A$4.40-billion in the Territory over the last financial year,” said Minister for Mining and Industry Nicole Manison. “Creating jobs for Territorians is this government’s number one priority. “The information gained from this grants programme will be vital in attracting more investment and more jobs in mineral exploration across the region. “We know the Territory has been through tough economic times. We are on the road to recovery and we are doing it with jobs, not cuts.” Round 13 awarded up to A$1-million in funding to five exploration drilling projects and seven geophysics projects from ten companies.
