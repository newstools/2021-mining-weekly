Toronto-listed Northern Dynasty said on Thursday that the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) had accepted Pebble Limited Partnership’s request to initiate an administrative appeal process with respect to southwest Alaska’s Pebble project. The USACE issued a negative ‘record of decision’ (ROD) in November. Northern Dynasty’s US-based subsidiary last month submitted a request for an appeal to the USACE’s Pacific Ocean division engineer, headquartered in Hawaii. In a letter dated February 24, the USACE confirmed the Pebble Partnership’s request for appeal is “complete and meets the criteria for appeal”.
