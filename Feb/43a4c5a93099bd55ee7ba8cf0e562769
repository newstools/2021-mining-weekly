PERTH (miningweekly.com) – First ore from the Iron Ridge mine, in Western Australia, has departed from the Port of Geraldton, with the next export vessel scheduled to arrive in late February. ASX-listed Fenix Resources on Friday said that previously reported mechanical issues with the Ya Tai 2 carrier had resulted in only 37 157 t of cargo being shipped, with the average iron grade of lumps and fines produced loaded being 63.3% and 61.5% respectively. The company told shareholders that it had sufficient product ready for its next planned shipment, with the carrier due to arrive on February 24, and scheduled for loading on February 27. Fenix’s Iron Ridge project is expected to produce some 1.25-million tons a year over a six-and-a-half-year mine life.
