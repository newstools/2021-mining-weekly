An updated resource statement for Aim-listed diamond producer BlueRock Diamonds’ Kareevlei diamond mine has resulted in the increase of net tonnes by 49%, to 10.36-million tonnes. This also pushes up the mine's net carats by 53%, to 516 200 ct, as well as its indicated resources by 19%. The Kareevlei west kimberlite cluster is located about 100 km northwest of Kimberley in the Northern Cape province. The original inferred level of confidence mineral resource estimate was completed in 2013 by Star Mineral Resource Consultants, based on historic exploration and sampling data. Subsequently, bulk sampling and later mining commenced on the KVW02 pipe and provided vital information in terms of the geology, grade and revenue. Additional geological information necessitated a mineral resource update in November 2018. Further work during 2019 and 2020 has resulted in significant changes to the KVW01 model, hence this current mineral resource update as of end December 2020. BlueRock executive chairperson Mike Houston says the resource statement confirms the provisional figures released in December 2020 and based on the company’s planned production of one-million tonnes a year, provides a minimum ten-year life-of-mine. “The board is confident that the resource will increase further once more work is completed on KV3, our largest pipe, where at present only 40% of this pipe's volume is included in resource.” He adds that he is pleased to note that the competent person, as a result of the mining to date, felt it appropriate to upgrade a significant tonnage of our resource from inferred to indicated. “This recategorisation further strengthens our confidence in Kareevlei’s future.” A number of exploration companies have worked on the Kareevlei kimberlite cluster and this has resulted in various phases of prospecting over the years.
