Russia's largest gold producer Polyus, which was last year hit by a major Covid-19 outbreak at its Olimpiada mine, has launched a vaccination programme, which makes vaccines available to all employees and contractors at any of its sites. The first delivery, which consists of 1 100 Covid-19 vaccine doses, has arrived at Olimpiada and Blagodatnoye and vaccinations began at the two sites on February 5. Nearly 500 workers were vaccinated during the first days of the programme. The Covid-19 outbreak at Olympiada last year infected nearly a quarter of workers. The Russian army, at the time, helped to set up a mobile hospital to fight the outbreak. At Olimpiada, Blagodatnoye and Verninskoye, vaccinations will take place on-site at first-aid posts, while at Kuranakh, Alluvialand Natalka, vaccination will be conducted at local medical centres.
