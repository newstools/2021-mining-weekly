PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Diversified miner BHP has announced a A$2-million donation to the 2021 Wooroloo and Perth Hills bushfire appeal, to support those affected by the recent bushfires in Perth. “The devastation and pain caused by this week’s bushfire has affected all of us. At BHP several of our colleagues have been impacted in some way, or have family members or friends who have. It’s heartbreaking to see people lose their homes and in some cases their livelihoods,” said BHP West Australian iron-ore asset president Brandon Craig. “BHP is committed to doing our part to support West Australian communities in times of crisis. This funding will help to provide critical financial aid and support services to the Wooroloo and Hills communities.” BHP has also added the Lord Mayor’s Disaster Relief Fund to the list of eligible organisations for the BHP employee Matched Giving Programme, which means for every dollar donated by a BHP employee, the company would match the notation with two dollars.
