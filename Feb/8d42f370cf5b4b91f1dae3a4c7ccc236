Global assets under management now stand at 3 765 t ($226-billion), just 4% shy of the intra-month record 3 915.8 t ($244-billion) set in early November. European funds captured the lion’s share of inflows, the WGC notes. North American funds had outflows of 6.3 t, while holdings in European funds grew by 17.5 t.
