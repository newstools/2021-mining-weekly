Aim-listed GoldStone Resources says both the mining operating permit and the water-use permit for the company's Homase South Pit within the Akrokeri-Homase (AKHM) project, in Ghana, have been awarded. The company now has all of the key permits required to progress the developments at the Homase South Pit. "We thank the Minerals Commission, Water Resources Commission of Ghana and all involved for the approval of our permits. With these approvals in place, there is clear demonstration of continued support for the project development from the Ghana government. “We are delighted with the granting of these permits which allows the Homase South Project to advance with its development phase,” says GoldStone CEO Emma Priestley.
