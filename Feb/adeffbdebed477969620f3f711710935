Twelve top-performing matriculants from disadvantaged schools around precious metals miner Sibanye-Stillwater's South African operations will be awarded full bursaries to pursue tertiary studies at local universities. “We are extremely pleased to be able to provide these top learners, who have achieved top results despite numerous challenges and disadvantages, with an opportunity to unlock their potential and contribute to the future of South Africa. We believe that our mining improves lives and that education is key to unlocking development. We look forward to seeing the first graduates from this special scheme coming through in 2022,” Sibanye CEO Neal Froneman said in a statement published this week. Sibanye launched its bursary scheme in 2019.
