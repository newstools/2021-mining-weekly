One year away from the planned start of major construction activities at the Blackwater gold project, south-west of Prince George, in British Columbia (BC), gold miner Artemis is gearing up to start early works on the site. The company has submitted its application to the BC government to undertake an early works construction programme, focusing on clearing of key infrastructure areas, including haul roads, the Stage 1 tailings storage facility and camp areas. In addition, construction of the mine access road and plant-site bulk earthworks will be fast-tracked to facilitate early mobilisation of the engineering, procurement and construction contractor to site upon receipt of major works permits. Permitting approvals are anticipated late in the second quarter. Artemis plans to develop the Blackwater project into a new 250Â 000 oz/y operation, which will cost less than C$600-million, and then finance two subsequent expansion stages from future operating cashflows.
