The French government has appealed a court ruling, which ordered the renewal of the Montagne dâ€™Or project joint venture (JV), in French Guiana, Toronto-listed Orea Mining reported on Thursday. The French court in December found in favour of the Montagne d'Or (owned 44.99% by Orea and 55.01% by Nord Gold), and had ordered the State to extend the mining concessions for a duration to be set within a period of six months from the notification of the court judgment. Orea said it remained of the opinion that the JV was entitled to the renewal of the Montagne d'Or concessions and both Orea and the JV intended to exercise all available rights to defend themselves in the appeal.
