PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Diversified miner South32 has pledged A$500 000 for bushfire assistance in Western Australia. The company said on Friday that the donation would be split between the Red Cross Disaster Relief and Recovery Fund and the Perth Lord Mayor’s Distress Relief Fund. “Our thoughts are with all those impacted by the bushfires. We would also like to express our deep gratitude to all the emergency services staff and volunteers working so hard to keep our communities safe,” said South32 CEO Graham Kerr. South32 is also matching employee contributions to a number of organisations supporting the bushfire response and recovery efforts. The Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia, and its members, earlier this week pledged A$2.5-million to support the families and communities affected by the fires.
