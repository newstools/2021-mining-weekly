Aim-listed Kropz has appointed engineering and construction firm Hatch Africa to complete an updated feasibility study on its Hinda phosphate project, in Congo-Brazzaville. The appointment follows the conclusion of a focussed logistics study, completed by Hatch in September 2020. The updated feasibility study, to be completed by September this year, will target a phased approach in line with the terms of the mining investment agreement, with initial production of one-million tonnes a year of phosphate rock being exported from the existing port facility at Pointe-Noire, which is 50 km from Hinda. A second phase production ramp-up to two-million tonnes a year will also be evaluated with export from a new port site, located north of Pointe-Noire. Congo-Brazzaville is experiencing its second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, this is not currently impacting on the work schedule being undertaken by Hatch, Kropz confirmed in a statement on February 4.
