PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Junior Azure Minerals has started a strategic review on its Mexican base metals projects, including its Alacrán silver/gold/copper project, and its Oposura zinc/lead/silver project. The company told shareholders on Monday that the options under review include a full or partial sale, a demerger, or other alternative transaction structures. “Since returning to exploration in Australia in mid-2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we have enjoyed outstanding success at the Andover nickel/copper project in the Pilbara region,” said Azure MD Tony Rovira. “Our focus is now clearly on advancing this exciting new opportunity through the exploration and mineral resources stages, together with exploring our newly acquired gold projects in Western Australia. “With the increased focus on Andover, we have received unsolicited approaches from numerous parties expressing interest in our Mexican projects. As we are currently constrained in our activities in Mexico, these approaches provide new opportunities whereby the Australian and Mexican assets could be advanced concurrently, with the high-quality, advanced stage projects in Mexico being attractive to larger companies.”
