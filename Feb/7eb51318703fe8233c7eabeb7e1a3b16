PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Mineral sands miner Base Resources has updated the resource estimate for its Kwale North Dune and Bumamani deposits at its Kwale operation, in Kenya. The resource estimate at the Kwale North Dune deposit has increased by 13%, to 194-million tonnes at an average heavy mineral grade of 1.5%, for some 2.9-million tonnes of heavy mineral, while the Bumumani mineral resource is now estimated at 5.9-million tonnes, grading 1.9%, for 0.115-million tonnes of heavy minerals. The ASX-listed Base had undertaken additional drilling and mineralogy assessments of the two deposits as part of the prefeasibility study to assess the viability of mining the two deposits, in an effort to extend the mine life of the Kwale operation. This feasibility work is due for completion early in the second quarter. The Kwale operation is expected to produce some 70 000 t to 80 000 t of rutile during 2021, along with between 270 000 t and 300 000 t of ilmenite, and 23 000 t to 27 000 t of zircon.
