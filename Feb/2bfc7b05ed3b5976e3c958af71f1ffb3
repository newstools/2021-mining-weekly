PERTH (miningweekly.com) – First gold has been produced at the Davyhurst gold processing plant, in Western Australia. ASX-listed Ora Banda Mining on Monday reported that the 1.2-million-tonne-a-year Davyhurst plant had been successfully re-commissioned, including the new 8.25 MW gas and diesel-fired power station, upgraded bore fields, process plant chemical storage facilities, upgraded road infrastructure and an upgraded 172-room camp. MD David Quinlivan said that the first gold pour marked a significant milestone for Ora Banda, as the company transitions from developer to producer. “We are pleased to reach this important milestone and congratulate all who have been involved in the accomplishment. It has been an impressive team effort to deliver this project into production under the uniquely challenging circumstances of 2020 and 2021. Our focus now remains on the continued ramp-up of activity as we progress towards steady state and the ultimate goal of delivering a long-life and sustainable gold operation.” Processing operations are currently stable and running at a throughput rate of one-million tonnes a year, and will continue to ramp up. The project is expected to produce some 81 000 oz/y of gold over an initial mine life of five years.
