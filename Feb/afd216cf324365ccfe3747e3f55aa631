As conditions in the global diamond market improve, Russian major Alrosa has decided to relaunch the processing plant of its Lomonosov mining and processing division, Severalmaz, on March 1. This is a month earlier than previously planned. The plant is set to process three-million tons of ore in 2021. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic and reduced production plan of Alrosa, Severalmaz switched to seasonal operations. The processing plant was suspended from May 16 to July 8, thereafter it was relaunched for the period until October 13. Mining was suspended from May 13 to November 1. Severalmazâ€™s diamond production in 2020 was 2.8-million carats.
