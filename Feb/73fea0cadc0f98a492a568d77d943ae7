Gold miner Harmony Gold Mining says an employee at its Target mine, in Welkom, has died following a seismic event that triggered a fall of ground on February 3. The relevant authorities were informed immediately and an investigation is under way. “On Friday last week, we declared a safety day and brought all our operations and surface plants to a complete standstill to reinforce and revitalise our journey towards improving safe behaviour in the workplace. “Harmony’s risk-based safety approach is aimed at ensuring that no life is lost at any of our mines. Every effort is made to embed a proactive safety culture within Harmony and our goal is zero harm,” says CEO Peter Steenkamp. Harmony’s board and executives have extended their deepest condolences, and those of the company, to the family, colleagues and friends of the deceased.
