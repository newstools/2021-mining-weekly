Aim-listed Altus Strategies says reverse circulation (RC) at its Tabakorole gold project, in Mali, has extended the strike length of the FT Prospect by at least 150 m to beyond 3 km. Altus holds a 49% equity interest in the project, as well as a 2.5% net smelter return royalty. Exploration activities at Tabakorole are being funded by joint venture partner ASX-listed Marvel Gold. Intersections from the latest round of drilling included 23 m of 2 g/t gold from 178 m, 24 m of 1.24 g/t from 13 m and 25 m of 0.81 g/t over 25 m from surface. The company has received results from the first eight of 39 holes of the 6Â 300 m RC programme. A further round of aircore drilling will shortly test a potential 1.3-km-long north-west extension to the project. Meanwhile, Marvel has started conducting a high-resolution ground magnetic survey to define further potential strike extensions and parallel targets.
