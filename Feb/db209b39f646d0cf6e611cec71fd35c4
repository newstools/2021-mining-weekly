Partial underground operations, as well as B3 and C-Zone development activities at the New Afton mine, in Kamploops, British Columbia, resumed over the weekend, bullion miner New Gold reported on Monday. Operations at the mine were halted last Tuesday, following a mud-rush incident that left one person dead and two injured. Milling, tailings operations and construction activities resumed late last week. “The restarting of mining activities is a significant step for the New Afton mine as we continue our safe and sequential return to full operations,” said president and CEO Renaud Adams. “As we move forward, our primary focus remains on the health, safety and wellbeing of our employees, contractors and their families and we will continue to provide counselling and support for them.”
