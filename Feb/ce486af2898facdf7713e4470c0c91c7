TSX-V-listed explorer and developer Deep-South Resources has appointed mining consultancy company the MSA Group of South Africa to produce an updated National Instrument (NI) 43-101 resource estimate for its 100%-owned advanced Haib copper project, in the south of Namibia. The report will follow the completion of the current drilling programme. Deep-South president and CEO Pierre Leveille says that, against the backdrop of a strong copper price, the company is “highly optimistic” for the coming years that Haib will garner additional interest from investors and other interested parties. The mandate of MSA includes site visits to verify data collection, quality assurance and controls, developing a structural geological model in collaboration with Deep-South’s geological team, assessing the presence of domains and modelling these domains in three dimensions, completing a geostatistical study for each domain and issuing an updated NI 43-101 resource estimate.
