Mineral exploration and development company Deep-South Resources has started drilling at its Haib copper project, in Namibia. Namibian drilling contractor Ferrodrill has delivered the first drill. A second drill is being mobilised and will soon be on site. The specific focus of the drilling campaign is to further delineate and grow the higher-grade zone of the deposit uncovered by Deep-South in 2019 as the company advances the project to feasibility stage. TSX-V-listed Deep-South and Ferrodrill intend to drill up to 10 000 m with a primary focus on the higher-grade zone of the deposit. In the first phase, 5 000 m will be drilled to infill gaps in previous drilling with a view to expand the higher-grade zone, better define the average grade of this zone, and eventually estimate a measured resource for this area with a goal to improve the overall grade of the project. The prospectivity of the higher-grade zone is demonstrated by numerous past drill intersections, the company says. Some holes to depths greater than 350 m will also be drilled to test the vertical extent of the deposit. The results of the first phase of the drill programme will serve as a basis for the planning of the second 5 000 m, which could include testing other anomalies located on Deep-Southâ€™s broader Haib copper project property.
