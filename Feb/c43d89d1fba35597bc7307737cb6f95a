Power utility Eskom says it will implement Stage 3 load-shedding from 13:00 on February 10 to 06:00 on February 11. This is necessary as the power generation system is still severely constrained as a result of high generation unit breakdowns during the past three days, as well as the need to replenish diminishing emergency generation reserves, it states. "The outlook for the power system is unpredictable and there is a high probability of load-shedding continuing on Thursday. "Eskom will continue to assess and communicate promptly as the situation changes. This morning a generation unit each at the Lethabo, Kendal and Duvha Power Stations were taken offline for repairs, adding to the high number of breakdowns and units that have failed to return to service as planned," it notes. Eskom currently has 4 858 MW of capacity on planned maintenance, while another 14 521 MW of capacity is unavailable due to breakdowns and delays.
