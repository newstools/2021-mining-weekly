PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Major Rio Tinto has reached agreement on an amended power contract that will allow the ISAL aluminium smelter, in Iceland, to continue operating with an improved competitive position. The agreement with power supplier Landsvirkjun, would deliver a more competitive power price and energy flexibility that is mutually beneficial for both ISAL and Landsvirkjun, the miner said this week. “We are pleased to have reached an agreement on a power price that, coupled with improved efficiencies we have delivered at the site, makes ISAL more competitive,” Rio Tinto aluminium CEO Alf Barrios said. “This provides a stronger footing to continue operations at the smelter and gives increased security for the team at ISAL, who have been doing an outstanding job in challenging conditions. We will continue to work to strengthen ISAL’s future in order to keep supplying low carbon aluminium to customers in Europe and North America, and making a significant contribution to Iceland’s economy.” Rio in July of last year submitted a formal complaint to the Icelandic Competition Authority (ICA) alleging abuse of market dominance by Landsvirkjun, asking the the ICA to address anti-competitive conduct by Landsvirkjun through discriminatory pricing and long-duration power contracts, so that the ISAL smelter and other Icelandic manufacturing and businesses are able to compete internationally. The miner said this week that in parallel to the new electricity agreement agreement, the company has decided to withdraw this complaint with ICA.
