PERTH (miningweekly.com) - The government of Greenland has extended the public consultation period for the Kvanefjeld rare earths project until June 1. ASX-listed Greenland Minerals on Friday said that this extension would result in a 23-weeek consultation period, instead of the originally determined 12 weeks. The company told shareholders that the logistical constraints brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic, had created increased logistical challenges in holding public meetings and information forums, while the government has also closed its borders between February 1 and February 28, imposing further limitations for specialist advisers and independent experts to participate in the consultation. Furthermore, municipal elections were also planned for April, which would affect the consultation process. “Kvanefjeld is a significant project for Greenland, as we openly support an extension to the public consultation period in order for the project to be effectively communicated and discussed among community and government stakeholders,” said Greenland Minerals MD Dr John Mair. “We appreciate that the government is undertaking the public consultation during a time of logistical challenges and are working cooperatively to support this.” The Kvanefjeld project is expected to cost some $505-million to develop and is expected to produce 32 000 t/y of rare earth oxide over an initial mine life of 37 years, based on a 108-million-tonne ore reserve.
