PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed diamond miner Lucapa Diamond Company has recovered its nineteenth diamond of more than 100 ct at its Lulo alluvial mine, in Angola. The miner on Friday announced the recovery of a 114 ct Type IIa D-colour white diamond from Mining Block 46, marking the third stone of over 100 ct to be recovered from this operation in the last eight weeks. The company told shareholders that the frequency of recovery of the high value stones from Mining Block 46 highlighted the prospectivity of the Canguige catchment and adjacent priority kimberlite.

To date, Mining Block 46 has averaged one diamond of more than 100 ct recovered for every 33 000 m3 of gravel processed. Lucapa earlier this week recovered a 215 ct diamond at its Mothae mine, in Lesotho.
