LSE- and JSE-listed Tharisa has declared a final dividend of $0.035 apiece for the financial year ended September 30, 2020. Executive chairperson Phoevos Pouroulis said in a statement on February 11 that the company had taken tough decisions over the last year, which hadÂ started to bear fruit and put the company on track to meet its production guidance for the current financial year. Guidance for the 2021 full-year is set at between 155 000 oz and 165 000 oz of platinum group metals (PGMs) and between 1.45-million and 1.55-million tonnes of chrome concentrates. This while demand for chrome and PGMs remains robust, with Tharisa being exposed to both good chrome and PGM basket prices at the moment. The company advised that the South African government had not made any further public comments on a proposed export tax for chrome. Tharisa remains of the view that the proposed tax benefits are far outweighed by risk, possibly breaching global trade regulations in the process as well.
