Surface operations at the New Afton mine, in Kamloops, British Columbia, have resumed, following Tuesdayâ€™s underground mud-rush incident that led to the death of one worker and injured two. The mill facility and tailings operations were restarted on Thursday afternoon, bullion miner New Gold said, adding that underground operations remained suspended. The company stated that it was working with authorities on a plan to safely and sequentially resume underground mining operations, including the development of the B3 and C-Zone. The mud-rush was localised underneath the Lift 1 cave in the isolated recovery zone area, which did not interact with the other areas of the mine, including the B3 and C-Zone areas.
