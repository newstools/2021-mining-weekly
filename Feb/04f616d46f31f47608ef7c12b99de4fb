PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Junior Woomera Mining has launched a strategic review of its lithium projects after fielding several unsolicited enquiries from corporate and other entities. The ASX-listed company on Thursday said that the review into the lithium assets would consider a range of potential partnering, funding and other asset initiatives with a focus on maximizing shareholder value. Woomera’s lithium assets include the Pilgangoora lithium project, the Mt Cattlin lithium project and the Binneringie lithium project, all within Western Australia. All three of the project areas are in close proximity to existing lithium mines, including ASX-listed Pilbara Minerals' own Pilgangoora lithium/tantalum project, and fellow-listed Galaxy Resources’ Mt Cattlin mine. “The strategic nature of the Pilgangoora project as well as the significant exploration upside potential across approximately 340 km2 of tenure is expected to drive interest from a range of parties during the review process,” said Woomera MD Kevin Seymour. “Following the review, Woomera intends to focus its exploration activities on its precious metals and copper/nickel assets at Mt Venn and Musgrave respectively.”
