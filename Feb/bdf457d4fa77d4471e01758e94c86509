JSE- and Aim-listed Pan African Resources expects its headline earnings per share (HEPS) for the six months ended December 31, 2020, to be between 80% and 92% higher year-on-year at between $0.0205 and $0.0217 apiece. This compares with HEPS of $0.0114 apiece reported for the six months ended December 31, 2019. The gold miner, with operations in South Africa, attributes the higher earnings to a 38.4% increase in gold revenue to $183-million, owing to a 27% increase in the average gold price achieved to $1 865/oz and 8.6% higher gold sales at 98 386 oz. Pan African will release its interim results on or about February 16.
