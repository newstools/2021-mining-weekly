To simplify its groupÂ structure and reduce costs, Aim-listed Goldplat has transferred a 74% holding in Goldplat Recovery, the South African gold recovery operation, from Gold Mineral Resources, an intermediate holding company, to the Goldplat group. This is part of a larger programme to remove the intermediate holding company from the group, its associated administrative cost and also to create an improved taxation structure. Goldplat holds 100% of Gold Mineral Resources, which still holds 49% of the Anumso exploration project, in Ghana, 100% of Gold Recovery Ghana and 100% of Kilimapesa Gold, in Kenya. It also holds a direct 74% interest in Goldplat Recovery.
