Brian Menell has been appointed nonexecutive chairperson of private UK firm Brazilian Nickel (BRN), following the recent $25-million investment by TechMet, of which he is chairperson and CEO. The South African industrialist succeeds Paul Lush, who is now deputy chairperson of BRN. Commenting on the changes, Lush said on Thursday that BRN had reached the stage where a new set of skills and relationships were needed to guide the company through its next phase. “I am delighted that Brian Menell has agreed to take up the role and I look forward to working with him to deliver on our plans.” Menell’s TechMet is building a portfolio of assets to secure supply of the metals critical to electric vehicles and renewable energy systems.  The company is focused on projects which produce, process or recycle these so-called technology metals and currently has operations in North America, South America, and Africa. BRN’s flagship project is the advanced-staged Piaui nickel project, in Brazil, with a resource of 72-million tonnes at 1.0% nickel and 0.05% copper, with 73% of the resource in the measured category.
