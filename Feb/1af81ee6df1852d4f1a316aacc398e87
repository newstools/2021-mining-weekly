TSX- and NYSE American-listed Tanzanian Gold (TanGold) has appointed mining executive and geoscientist Andrew Cheatle as COO. TanGold said Cheatle, who joined the board in December, would spend a considerable time in Tanzania as the company and its joint venture partner, the State Mining Company (Stamic), sought to advance the Buckreef gold project. The Buckreef projectâ€™s updated mine plan was recently approved, the company added. The Buckreef project is based on an expanded mineral resource base and the treatment of its mineable reserves in two standalone plants. Measured and indicated resources stand at a combined tonnage of 35.88-million tonnes at 1.77 g/t gold containing 2.04-million ounces.
