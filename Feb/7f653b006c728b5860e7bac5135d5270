Following its successful $65-million fundraise last week, Aim-listed development company Bacanora Lithium has kicked off initial site activities at the Sonora project, in Mexico. Bacanora is building the project together with its partner, Ganfeng Lithium – the world's largest lithium metals producer. Production of battery grade lithium products are expected in 2023. Bacanora says it has engaged a local specialist ecological services company based in Sonora to begin initial site works. These activities will involve the rescue and removal of surface vegetation and topsoil in the area required for the construction of the lithium processing plant. A team of 15 personnel has been deployed to site, including two ecologists, a biologist, and a forestry engineer. Most of these personnel reside in the local area. In addition, the Bacanora construction team has started the preparatory work required to upgrade the main access road to the site in preparation for providing access for heavy equipment to commence the bulk site earthworks later in the year. The tender process for this work has commenced and is focusing on using local construction and engineering groups from the surrounding Sonora region. Transmission of engineering drawings and documentation from Ganfeng and its equipment suppliers in China has commenced and the final engineering packages will be delivered to Bacanora in the second quarter of 2021. In addition, Bacanora is working with its principal equipment suppliers to finalise a schedule for the delivery of the larger items of processing equipment for delivery in 2022.  As part of this schedule, orders for the larger items of process equipment that have delivery schedules of over 12 months will be placed during the third quarter for delivery to site in late 2022.
