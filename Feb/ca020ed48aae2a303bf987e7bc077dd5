PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold developer Pantoro has provided ASX-listed GR Engineering Services for a letter of intent for awarding a A$57-million engineering, procurement and construction works contract for the processing facility at the Norseman gold project, in Western Australia. Pantoro said on Wednesday that the company would complete contract documentation before the end of February this year. Detailed engineering works would start immediately, and GR Engineering would place orders for long-lead items, including the 3.3 MW ball mill. “The competitive tender process drew a number of quality submissions, reflecting the quality of the project and the preparatory work completed as part of the definitive feasibility study,” said Pantoro MD Paul Cmrlec. “We are pleased that GR Engineering will undertake work with their proven track record in new processing plant builds in recent years. GR Engineering has been the dominant supplier of new process plant builds in Western Australia in recent times, and we look forward to drawing on their expertise in construction of the plant at Norseman.” Pantoro holds a 50% interest in the Norseman project, where a 2020 definitive feasibility estimated that the project could produce some 108 000 oz/y over an initial seven years. The study estimated a pre-production capital cost of A$89-million for the Norseman project, with the processing plant based on a capacity of one-million tonnes a year, with flexibility to expand to 1.5-million tonnes a year.
