Shares of mineral exploration and development company Cornish Metals started trading on London’s Aim on Tuesday morning. The company, which focuses on projects in Cornwall, in the UK, raised £8.2-million. The proceeds will be used for further drilling at the United Downs copper/tin project to determine the resource potential of a 1 000 m strike section of the target area, to conduct initial field work on other high priority exploration targets within trucking distance of the South Crofty mine, in Cornwall. Drilling at United Downs will start in late March or early April, Cornish says.
