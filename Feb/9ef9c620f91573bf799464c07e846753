JSE- and NYSE-listed precious metals miner Sibanye-Stillwater has appointed Richard Cox executive VP of its South African gold operations, effective February 1. His appointment follows the untimely passing of Shadwick Bessit on January 16. Cox has more than 27 years’ experience in the gold and platinum group metals (PGMs) mining industries, with his last appointment before joining Sibanye being Anglo American Platinum’s Mogalakwena PGMs complex senior GM. He has a proven record of leading sizeable operations in achieving improved safety, health and environmental performance, launching cutting edge business solutions, and driving greater efficiencies, according to Sibanye. Sibanye CEO Neal Froneman welcomes Cox to the executive team and says he looks forward to the positive input Cox will bring to the South African gold operational team. “We are grateful to be able to draw from an extensive bench of experienced managers in our talent pool.”
