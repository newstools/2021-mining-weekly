Specialist graphite producer and graphene developer Tirupati Graphite’s group company Tirupati Speciality Graphite (TSG) has been accorded the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (Reach) certification for its range of expandable graphite products for marketing and sales into the European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA). The Reach certification enables the sale of its entire range of expandable graphite products into the EU and EEA and is a recognised international standard for these products globally. Since certification, the company has started sales and bulk supplies to several large consumers of its expandable graphite products across the EU and EEA, having successfully completed pilot trials and qualifications. There has also been an increased demand for the company's expandable graphite products as users look to source products outside of China, Tirupati said in a statement on February 10. The certification also opens the doors for the company to market and sell across the EU and EEA its newly developed foam manufacturing technology and product GrafEN45545, a product compliant with European Standard EN 45545 - Fire Protection on Railway Vehicles to Hazard Level 3. “This bodes well given the upcoming UK Fire Safety Bill, which is targeted to address issues to ensure fire safety in all buildings. The registration will open more doors for us, in addition to qualifications already achieved and we expect additional successes from our foam technology collaborations,” Tirupati CEO Shishir Poddar commented. The company has operations in Madagascar and India.
