Latin America-focused Atico Mining has reported a temporary work stoppage at its El Roble mine, to allow for repair on the pipeline that transports material to the tailings facility. On Thursday last week, the relief valve for the tailings pipe malfunctioned and as a result some material was discharged. The company said that operations were immediately halted, while repairs were made. Provincial authorities have inspected the repairs and the company reported on Tuesday that it expected to gradually resume operations in the next 24 hours.
