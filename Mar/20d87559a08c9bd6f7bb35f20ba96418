WARSAW â€“ Polish copper and silver producer KGHM has no plans to change its 55% stake in its Chilean Sierra Gorda mine, the company's deputy head Pawel Gruza said on Thursday. "Sierra Gorda is one of KGHM's strategic assets. In this moment we do not expect changes of our capital involvement in this investment," Gruza told a press conference following the company's fourth quarter results. Investors have been keen for information on KGHM's plans regarding Sierra Gorda mine, its flagship foreign asset, after its Japanese partner Sumitomo Metal Mining put its 45% stake on the block last October.
