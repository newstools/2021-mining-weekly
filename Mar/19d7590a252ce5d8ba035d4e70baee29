Texas and other red states sued the Biden administration for rescinding permission to build the $8-billion Keystone XL pipeline after the Trump administration supported it. President Joe Biden lacks unilateral authority to change energy policy set by Congress, according to a complaint filed in a Texas federal court on Wednesday. The suit was filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen. “The Executive’s unilateral decision to revoke the Keystone XL permit is contrary to the constitutional structure to which the states agreed at the time of ratification, “ the states said. “The Executive’s decision also encroaches upon the states’ abilities to steward and control the lands within their borders. The case is joined by attorneys general from 16 states, including Alabama, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Utah and Wyoming.
