Aim-listed metals explorer and developer Power Metal Resources has received “encouraging results” from the airborne electromagnetic (AEM) surveys recently flown over the South Ghanzi project, in the Kalahari Copper Belt, in Botswana. The South Ghanzi project is part of a strategic joint venture (SJV) with London-listed Kavango Resources and it covers precious, base and strategic metals opportunities in Botswana. Power Metal and Kavango each have a 50% interest in the SJV. In a statement on March 17, Power Metal confirmed that initial results from the AEM surveys have been used to augment next steps of field exploration across the JV’s licence area, and that data processing is currently under way, with the results expected later in the spring, and with a goal of identifying targets for test drilling in the first half of this year. Power Metal CEO Paul Johnson said the pathway to major metal discoveries “requires a disciplined and targeted step-by-step approach, something which is being applied to the South Ghanzi exploration model”. With the company’s SJV partners, Power Metal is pushing ahead with the next stage of work, which is focused on delineating drill targets as soon as possible, the objective of which will be a large-scale copper/silver metal discovery, or discoveries.
