PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Graphite developer Bass Metals has reported a 41% increase in the graphite mineral resource at its Graphmada mining complex, in Madagascar. The project is now estimated to host a mineral resource of 20.2-million tonnes, of more than 90% large flake graphite at 4% total graphitic carbon, with Bass noting that the measured and indicated resource had also increased by 41%, to 6.2-million tonnes at 4.3% total graphitic carbon. Bass told shareholders on Tuesday that the results of the latest exploration programme supported the assessment that the Graphmada mineralisation was continuous from Mahela through to Lohorano, an approximate strike length of some 4.5 km. The resource also delivered additional tonnes to an orebody already commercially prove to produce on-specification concentrate, the company added. The company will continue to explore and develop the Graphmada project, Bass said on Tuesday, with the strategy of expanding Graphmada for large-scale mining and processing in parallel to downstream development of advanced carbon products.
