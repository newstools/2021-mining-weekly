Bullion major Barrick Gold president and CEO Mark Bristow on Thursday described the late President of Tanzania, John Magufuli, as a “visionary statesmen who saw the value of a thriving mining sector”. Magufuli died on Wednesday at the age of 61 from a heart condition. In a statement mourning the loss, Bristow said Magufuli partnered with Barrick to create Twiga Minerals – a joint venture that would “stand as a monument to the late President’s foresight”. Twiga manages Barrick’s mines in Tanzania and shares the economic benefits they generate equally between the company and its stakeholders in that country. Bristow said Twiga should serve as a model for future partnerships between governments and mining companies in Africa.
