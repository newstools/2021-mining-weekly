PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Junior Jupiter Mines has reported a solid fourth quarter for the period ending February, with the company’s Tshipi Borwa manganese mine, in South Africa, producing 891 256 t of ore. Manganese production for the fourth quarter was down from the 925 652 t produced in the previous quarter, as operations were affected by excessive rainfall and fleet mobilization delays resulting from the Covid-19 lockdown. However, Jupiter noted on Friday that Tshipi had achieved its second highest year of exports for the full year, despite the challenging environment. In the full year, production reached 3.3-million tonnes, with sales reaching 3.4-million tonnes, with the fourth quarter contributing more than one-million tonnes to the sales figures. Revenue for the fourth quarter reached A$130.7-million, bringing full year sales revenue for the 2021 financial year to A$496.7-million, with net profits after tax recorded as A$26.3-million for the quarter and A$134.9-million for the full year. Jupiter during the quarter took the decision to demerge its iron-ore assets into a separately listed entity known as Juno Minerals, which will be listed on the ASX by mid-May.
