Canadian mining giant Barrick Gold has paid tribute to US civil rights leader Vernon Jordan, who passed away on Monday at the age of 85. Jordan served on Barrick’s international advisory board since its inception over two decades ago. “He was a vigorous and effective participant in all advisory board debates that concerned the company, its future, its employees and the social and political environments in which Barrick operates around the world. We shall miss his brilliance, great good humour and sound judgement he brought to bear on all subjects under board consideration and we shall remember him with affection and respect as a valuable colleague and a loyal friend,” said Barrick international advisory board chairperson Brian Mulroney. Born in, 1935, in Atlanta, Jordan grew up in the segregated South and became an influential leader in the civil rights movement, Washington politics and Wall Street. Jordan was a key adviser to former President Bill Clinton during his first Presidential campaign.
