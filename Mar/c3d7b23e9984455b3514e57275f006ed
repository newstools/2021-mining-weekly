WARSAW - Two miners died in an accident at a coal mine owned by PGG, Poland's biggest coal producer, in the southern city of Myslowice, the city's mayor said on Thursday. "There was a tragic accident... Two miners were killed and two were injured," Myslowice mayor Dariusz Wojtowicz said in a Facebook post. The State Mining Authority said earlier that there were four miners in the area, two of whom managed to get out. The incident occurred in the afternoon in the Myslowice-Wesola mine, more than 600 metres underground. A representative said that there had been a rockfall underground but that he did not have any more details. PGG officials were not immediately available for comment.
