Dr Mandla Gantsho will retire as chairperson of Kumba Iron Ore to devote more time to his personal business interests. He will step down from the board, including from the board committees on which he serves, with effect from the end of the company’s annual general meeting to be held on May 14. “Chairing the Kumba board since 2017 has been an enormous privilege during what has been a period of considerable volatility and change for the business. "I am pleased to have played a part in contributing to a great South African business that will continue to make a significant contribution to our economy and to the communities in which we operate. I am grateful to the board and shareholders of Kumba for their support,” Gantsho says. “On behalf of the management team, we wish Dr Gantsho well and thank him for his astute leadership of the board. Personally, I’d like to thank him for his counsel to me as CEO and for the insights he has brought to our thinking and board discussions,” comments CEO Themba Mkhwanazi. Mark Cutifani, CEO of parent company Anglo American, added an additional note of thanks, by saying: “Mandla’s experience across the private and public sectors, in mining, development and infrastructure, brings richness to any business debate and we thank him for his support as chair of Kumba.”
