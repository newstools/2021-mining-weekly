TSX-V-listed Discovery Harbour’s value doubled this week as the junior announced that Australian major Newcrest Mining would earn into its Fortuity 89 property, in Nevada. Discovery Harbour holds the early-stage epithermal gold Fortuity 89 property, which covers close to 34 km2 and is located about 4 km west of Discovery Harbour’s Caldera property. I am particularly pleased to welcome Newcrest given their well-recognised global expertise in epithermal gold deposits. I believe they will effectively mobilise the necessary resources to advance Fortuity 89 from its current early exploration stage compared to our Caldera property,” said president and CEO Mark Fields. Discovery Harbour’s stock rose from $0.045 a share last Friday to C$0.09 a share on Wednesday.
