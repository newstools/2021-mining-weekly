Responsibly sourced emeralds from the Kagem mine, in Lufwanyama, Zambia, will create the centrepiece of a new fine jewellery collection by US-based designer Sandy Leong. A portion of the sales proceeds will be used to support the Gemfields Foundation – the charitable arm of gemstone supplier and Kagem’s parent company Gemfields. The foundation supports community and conservation projects in Africa. Leong is partnering with Gemfields on the release of Sol, a new collection featuring responsibly sourced emeralds, 18 kt recycled yellow gold and conflict-free white diamonds. The pioneer partnership will support the ongoing efforts of the Gemfields Foundation by contributing 10% of all sales from the Sol collection towards specific projects centred on children and education. The Sol collection comprises 18 original pieces sculpted in Leong's signature organic silhouettes. Each piece was made available for purchase ahead of World Water Day on March 22. Each year, World Water Day ushers the international community into six weeks of sustainably focused conversations, running through Earth Month in April.
