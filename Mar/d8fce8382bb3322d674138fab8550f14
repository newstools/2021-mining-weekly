Multinational law firm Herbert Smith Freehills partner and Africa co-chair Peter Leon has been ranked as one of the top mining lawyers in the world by UK research firm Law Business Research legal practitioner publication Who’s Who Legal (WWL), which listed Leon as a 2021 Global Elite Thought Leader for Mining. Leon, based in Johannesburg, is a specialist in mineral regulatory issues in Anglophone Africa with a particular focus on crisis management, resource nationalism, investment protection and international best practice. He is also international legal counsel to the Ministry of Industry and Mineral Resources, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, advising on the Kingdom’s mineral law reform programme. Leon holds an LLM (first class honours) and Diploma in Comparative Legal Studies from the University of Cambridge. Additionally, he has an LLB (cum laude) and a BA (awarded with distinction in Roman Law) from the University of Cape Town, Herbert Smith Freehills' website states. He was elected as senior scholar of Christ's College, Cambridge, and is a council member of the Legal Practice Division of the International Bar Association responsible for the Africa Regional Forum and the section for energy, natural resources and infrastructure law. Over nearly two decades, WWL has used the recommendations of clients and private practitioners to pick out the leading experts in a wide range of practice areas around the world. “These individuals are worthy of special mention owing not only to their vast expertise and experience advising on some of the world’s most significant and cutting-edge legal matters, but also their ability to innovate, inspire and go above and beyond to deliver for their clients,” WWL says. Only one other South African lawyer, Werksmans Attorneys director and mining, environmental and resources practice head Chris Stevens, is listed as a 2021 Global Elite Thought Leader for Mining alongside Leon on the WWL global elite mining thought leaders 2021 list.
