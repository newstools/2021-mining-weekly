South Africa’s Cabinet has approved the country’s updated draft Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) in response to climate change, which will be released for public consultation next week. The updated NDC outlines South Africa’s target for limiting greenhouse gas emissions as required in line with the country’s status as a signatory to the Paris Agreement on climate change. South Africa has committed to submitting its updated NDC to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ahead of the next round of climate negotiations, also known as COP 26, which will take place in Glasgow, Scotland, in November. “Since the adoption of the Paris Agreement in December 2015, South Africa has made significant progress in moving towards the development and implementation of its NDCs,” the Cabinet said in a statement following its meeting on March 24. “The updated draft NDC takes into account South Africa’s national circumstances, legal requirements of the Paris Agreement, equity and the latest science,” the statement added. Environment, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Barbara Creecy is expected to formally provide details on the contents of the draft NDC on Tuesday March 30, after which it will be made available on the department’s website. The updated draft NDC for South Africa is expected to address adaptation, mitigation, finance and investment requirements. In recent weeks, Creecy has been particularly vocal about the finance component, arguing that a breakthrough on finance would be essential for success in Glasgow.
