PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed GWR has delivered its first iron-ore shipment under its offtake agreement with Hong Kong trader Pacific Minerals from its flagship C4 iron-ore deposit, in Western Australia. The company on Monday told shareholders that following the successful staging of its first shipment of 52 425 t of high-grade lump, the company has now secured its second vessel and will begin loading with the aim of departing in late March. Stage 1 mining of the C4 deposit continues on site, with iron-ore being stockpiled at the Port of Geraldton. While production and crushing operations at C4 are continuing, GWR has reported that haulage operations have been impacted by issues such as unplanned maintenance, road closures owing to weather, and storm damage to the haulage transfer station. “Despite a number of challenges, we are confident we can capitalise on the current buoyant iron-ore price, with ore crushing now at 90% of full production and challenges with our haulage fleet expected to be addressed through the latter part of March and early April,” said GWR chairperson Gary Lyons.
