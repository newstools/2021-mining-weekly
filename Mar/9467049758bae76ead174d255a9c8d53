Aim-listed AfriTin Miningâ€™s total production for the 2021 financial year, ended February 28, amounted to 473 t of tin concentrate from the Uis tin mine, in Namibia. Total production was supported by a strong production of 194.5 t in the last quarter, which was a 28% quarterly increase in output and exceeded the 180 t target set by the company. The mine has been steadily ramping up production to above steady-state capacity, reaching nameplate capacity in November 2020. The first production of saleable tin concentrate was achieved in August 2019. This while the company is in the process of conducting testwork to investigate the feasibility of magnetically separating tantalum minerals from the tin concentrate, in its endeavour to produce by-products from tantalum concentrates. AfriTin already has an offtake agreement in place with AfriMet for future tantalum concentrate produced at the mine.
