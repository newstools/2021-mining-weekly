Donlin Gold, the 50:50 joint venture between Barrick Gold and Novagold Resources, has confirmed a follow-up drill programme for the Alaska project this year, following the strong outcome of its 2020 campaign. Additional confirmation and extension drilling is planned, with specifics to be finalised once all assay results from the 2020 drill programme have been integrated into an interim model update. Thereafter, the focus will shift to updating the feasibility study. Barrick and Novagold last week announced the final assay results from the 2020 drill programme, which the companies said exceeded expectations. Results demonstrated higher drilled grade-thickness than predicted by previous modelling. “On every level, the results of the largest drill programme at Donlin Gold in 12 years have been incredibly rewarding for the partnership and all stakeholders. “Since we released the initial results in August last year, the assays have consistently revealed higher-grade gold intersections. These have only served to elevate Donlin Gold’s confidence in the recent geologic modelling concepts developed by the Barrick and Novagold teams, while confirming multiple high-grade extensions in both the intrusive (igneous) and sedimentary rocks, including near surface. One such near-surface hit in drill hole DC20-1938, revealed today in this final set of results, intersected 17.96 m grading 10.5 g/t gold including 3.96 m grading 28.0 g/t gold starting at 1.83 m drilled depth. Needless to say, the assay results from the 2020 drill programme further strengthen our resolve and belief in the extraordinary nature of Donlin Gold and provide us with a wealth of new knowledge to integrate into an updated geologic model,” said Novagold CEO Greg Lang. Barrick’s Mark Bristow extended his thanks to the Donlin Gold team and said that the strong results from the 2020 campaign were a major step forward in improving the geological confidence in the Donlin project.
