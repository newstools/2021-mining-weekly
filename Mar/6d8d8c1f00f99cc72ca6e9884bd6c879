Mineral developer Canadian Manganese Company (CMC) on Friday announced an agreement with Maximos Metals as part of its vision to create a new technology metals company. Maximos holds nickel and cobalt interests in Labrador, while CMC owns the Woodstock manganese property in New Brunswick. The new technology metals companyâ€™s immediate focus would be on the Woodstock manganese project, which hosts the near-surface, Plymouth carbonate-hosted manganese deposit containing an inferred resource of 44.77-million tonnes, grading 9.85% manganese. Manganese has been identified by the Canadian and US governments as a critical mineral that is essential for the national defence, aerospace, technology and energy sectors. Meanwhile, CMC also announced that it would complete a private placement equity finance through an offering of subscription receipts at C$0.30 a flow-through receipt and C$0.225 a non-flow-through receipt. The company said it had received subscriptions for at least C$5-million.
