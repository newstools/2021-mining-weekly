London-listed Kenmare Resources has announced that there is currently a surge of Covid-19 cases at its Moma Titanium Minerals mine, in Mozambique. The company has 177 employees in isolation, with the majority of them being asymptomatic. Kenmare advises that although the larger number of cases at the moment is limiting availability of the workforce, including senior management, the business is being managed to mitigate the impact and production has continued at normal levels. In addition to pre-existing physical distancing and hygiene protocols that Kenmare has in place, the company has initiated blanket testing of the workforce on the site every two weeks and is targeting a reduction of this interval. This helps to identify and isolate positive cases more quickly and limit the spread of the virus. Meanwhile, Kenmare will release its preliminary results for 2020 on March 24.
