Activities at the El Gallo gold mine, in Mexico, have been restored, NYSE- and TSX-listed McEwen Mining reported on Monday, announcing that it had reached a new ten-year agreement with nearby communities. The agreement provided for additional support the communities and greater long-term certainty for the El Gallo operation, the miner said in a statement. McEwen on March 15 reported a blockade of the main access to the property by nearby communities. At the time, McEwen said that individuals believed that the yearly payments and infrastructure improvements made to the local communities should increase significantly. El Gallo has been residual heap leaching since the third quarter of 2018 and is expected to contribute 3% to 4% to the companyâ€™s gold-equivalent production in 2021.
