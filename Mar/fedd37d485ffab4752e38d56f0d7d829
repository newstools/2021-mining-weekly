LIMA â€“ Antapaccay copper mine in Peru, controlled by Glencore, on Thursday announced the suspension of operations due to a road blockade by local communities, said the miner in a statement. The mine near the city of Espinar in the Cusco region is the sixth largest copper producer in Peru, accounting last year for 8.8% of Peru's total copper production.
