A group of four individual appellants intends to appeal a decision granting NYSE- and TSX-listed Platinum Group Metals (PTM) a mining right for the Waterberg joint venture project. The Department of Mineral Resources and Energy (DMRE) granted the mining right on February 3. PTM stresses in a statement that all requirements specified under the  Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act had been complied with. It adds that it completed well-documented  extensive and meaningful consultations with recognised representatives in local communities, the DMRE and government. The Waterberg project is projected to be a large palladium, platinum, rhodium and gold mine and the company anticipates that its development will result in significant positive spin-offs in terms of investments, exports, jobs and skills development. “Our definitive feasibility study announced in September 2019, combined with a positive outlook for palladium, highlights that the local Waterberg communities and the broader Limpopo region in particular would benefit from the planned investment,” PTM points out. PTM is the majority owner of the project, located in South Africa, with partners being Impala Platinum Holdings, Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation, Hanwa and Mbombo Wethu Consultants.
