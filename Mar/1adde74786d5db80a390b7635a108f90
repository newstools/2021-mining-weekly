Black-empowered resources company Exxaro Resources has achieved four years without any fatalities across its mining operations. This is a remarkable milestone the miner set out to achieve as part of the company’s Khetha Ukuphepa (translated as “Choose Safely”) campaign, which was launched in 2019. The campaign highlights the efforts that have been made to achieve Exxaro’s goal of zero harm in the company and across all its assets. The last unfortunate fatality at Exxaro happened in March 2017 at Matla Coal, Mine 2 Operation. Since then, the company has strengthened its efforts to improve safety measures and awareness to avoid more tragic losses. As the cornerstone of its Zero Harm pledge, Exxaro’s campaign has ensured that every employee adheres to strict safety standards and can return home unharmed. One of the strategic initiatives of the campaign has been to communicate and reinforce the importance of individual safety by educating employees about potential hazards such as machinery, dust inhalation, silicosis, tuberculosis, or even seemingly harmless obstacles like noise or fatigue. Exxaro CEO Mxolisi Mgojo reinforces how important the forum and the commitment to safety are, stating that, “What we in the mining industry also acknowledge are the thousands of lives lost in the past 100 years. These are souls dearly missed to this day. And we seek not to have such deadly repetitions.” “This marks a great milestone for our company and for the future of the South African mining industry. “The leadership and strategic initiatives to improve safety regulations have ensured that all of our employees can work in an environment they can trust and that they can return home to their loved ones unharmed,” comments Exxaro group manager for safety and health Dr Joseph Matjila.
