Russian nickel and platinum group metals (PGMs) miner Nornickel has downgraded its 2021 production guidance, following the flooding of two mines in Siberia. Nickel production will be 35 000 t short of its 2021 guidance, while copper output will be 65 000 t and PGMs 22 t short. The Oktyabrsky and Taimyrsky mines, where operations were suspended on February 24, would only be restored to full capacity in the next three to four months, the company said on Tuesday.
