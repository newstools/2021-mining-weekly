Czech-based Draslovka Holdings will be expanding its footprint into Africa and the Americas. The company, a family-owned group producing cyanide-based specialty chemicals, has developed a new proprietary hydrogen cyanide reactor, which has been successfully operating in a production facility, in the Czech Republic for the past two years. The technology is significantly more efficient than the previous generation of production technologies, the company said in a media release on March 11. Draslovka is now ready to roll out its technology on a global scale by building new production sites for solid sodium cyanide. Hydrogen cyanide is a key raw material used in Draslovka’s mining chemicals, tire and rubber accelerators, chelating agents, specialty chemicals and intermediate products. In the initial phase, Draslovka plans to focus on Africa and the Americas, where the company is seeing growing markets for its products. In Africa, the company intends to build a new hydrogen cyanide production facility including mining chemicals, and agrochemicals within the next three years. Following this, the company says it would like to add a cyanide-based specialty chemicals production plant that will bring its innovative downstream products closer to customers. The second-highest priority for the company is to establish a similar project in the Americas, with its preferred option being the US, where Draslovka has been actively looking for opportunities for quite some time.
