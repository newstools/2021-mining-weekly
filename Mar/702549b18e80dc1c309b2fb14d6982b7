PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Commissioning activities have started at the Plomosas processing plant, in Mexico. ASX-listed Consolidated Zinc on Wednesday reported that the mill and wet end of the plant would be commissioned from March 13, adding that a short commissioning period was expected. “We are very pleased with the progress made to date commissioning the Plomosas plant. Our modelling indicates a bright future for Consolidated Zinc at Plomosas and the increased cashflow from running the Plomosas and Aldama plants during the second quarter of 2021 should allow Consolidated Zinc to accelerate the expansion of the Plomosas plant to 200 t/d during 2021,” said Consolidated Zinc MD Brad Marwood. The company started zinc production at Plomosas in September 2018 and achieved commercial production in December 2018. The miner is now ramping production through the third party-owned Aldama concentrator and has an offtake agreement to sell all zinc concentrate produced to the Met-Mex Smelter located in Torreon, Mexico, a part of the Penoles Group. Consolidated Zinc previously said that the Plomosas plant refurbishment would cost some $1.35-million, and would allow for the expansion of the plant from 3 000 t/m to 6 000 t/m. “The size of the operations in production matters, as does direct control of the process, and the steps taken in the last few months strengthen our business model,” said Marwood on Wednesday.
