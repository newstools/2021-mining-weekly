PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The federal government has approved Major Project status for ASX-listed EcoGraf’s battery anode material facility, in Western Australia. “We are delighted to receive this support from the Australian government as our development is positioned as an integral part of the downstream modern manufacturing of battery and critical minerals in Australia,” said EcoGraf MD Andrew Spinks. “EcoGraf’s development strongly aligns with recent legislative policy changes in Europe that require higher standards of environmental and social governance in battery supply chains. Unprecedented investment is currently under way to establish self-sufficient and sustainable battery manufacturing supply chains to support the electric vehicle industry.” Production capacity for Stage 1 of the proposed facility is 5 000 t/y of battery-grade spherical graphite, increasing to 20 000 t/y with the completion of Stage 2, with the processing plant expected to cost some $72-million and employing some 275 staff during construction. The development of the processing facility was part of the company’s vertically integrated graphite business positioned to support the global transition to clean energy and electric mobility. The federal government’s confirmation of Major Project status for the battery anode material facility comes just a day after the Australian government released a Resources Technology and Critical Minerals Processing roadmap, aimed at leveraging Australia’s critical minerals and resources sector to create more jobs and economic opportunities for manufacturing. The government has made available A$1.3-billion in the Modern Manufacturing Initiative to help develop projects in this priority area, and to help manufacturers scale up production, commercialise products and tap into global supply chains.
