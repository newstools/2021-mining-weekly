Power utility Eskom says it will implement Stage 2 load-shedding from 17:00 on Wednesday until 23:00 on Friday as the generation capacity is severely constrained. "There is a probability that load-shedding may be implemented at short notice should any further breakdowns occur before then," it warns. It further warns that load-shedding may continue throughout the weekend. Continued poor performance at the Kusile, Duvha and Tutuka power stations, as well as delays in returning some other units to service, and breakdowns over the last week, have resulted in the need to implement load-shedding. "We currently have 6 212 MW on planned maintenance, while another 11 217 MW of capacity is unavailable due to breakdowns and delays. This has led to our inability to supply the increasing demand," the utility states. Eskom has had to extensively use the emergency generation reserves, which are being rapidly depleted and this period of load-shedding will be used to replenish the emergency generation reserves.
