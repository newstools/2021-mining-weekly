JSE-listed Wescoal has appointed nonexecutive director Robinson Ramaite as interim group CEO, effective March 15. This comes as Reginald Demana announced his resignation in January and that he isÂ leaving the company on March 31. Ramaite is a former director-general of the Department of Public Service and Administration, as well as a former adviser to various Ministers. Wescoal states that he has been involved in the mining sector for more than ten years and occupies positions on the boards of various listed and non-listed companies. The company is confident that Ramaite has the necessary strategic leadership, management, mining, legal, board and committee experience to effectively lead the company until it appoints a permanent group CEO. Meanwhile, Wescoal has also appointed nonexecutive director Zukie Siyotola as chairperson of its Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee, effective April 1, following the resignation of Kabela Maroga to pursue other commitments. From April, the committee will comprise three independent nonexecutive directors, namely Siyotola, Nomavuso Mnxsana and Andile Mabizela.
