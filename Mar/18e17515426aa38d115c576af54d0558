Global miner De Beers has appointed Golder as the prime contractor to carry out the closure of the Victor mine – Ontario’s first and only diamond mine which operated from 2008 through 2019. Golder was selected to carry out the remaining closure activities, including demolition of the remaining infrastructure and rehabilitation of the site. “Golder’s multi-disciplinary team of construction, environmental and mining specialists will be implementing De Beers’ closure plan, having mobilised to site on January 1, 2021 and with planned works into 2023,” says Golder Canadian region president Greg Herasymuik. Golder will manage activities at the site, including decommissioning the openpit, dismantling of surface infrastructure, rehabilitating the site and establishing long-term monitoring. The company will provide opportunities so that the local community can continue to be involved at Victor. “We know that mines have a finite life, and we’re proud to have supported De Beers group throughout the successful life of the Victor mine, and now into planned closure,” says Herasymuik.
