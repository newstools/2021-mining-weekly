Metals miner Taseko on Tuesday secured a court win in the Arizona Court of Appeals, which confirmed the Superior Court of Arizona's 2019 decision in favour of the Florence copper project and rejected arguments made by the Town of Florence. The appeals court upheld Florence Copper's right to mine its property within the town, and confirmed the awarding of $1.7-million in legal fees and costs to Florence Copper. "We are certainly happy with the appellate court decision which draws to a close all outstanding litigation brought by the town," said Taseko president Stuart McDonald. "While it is the outcome we expected, the closure this decision brings is important for not only for the company, but for all those who benefit from the social and economic contribution we are making to the region." With the town council’s legal challenges out of the way, Taseko is focusing on advancing the 40 000 t/y of Florence cathode copper project. One of the two key permits necessary for commercial operations has been granted by the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality, and the federal Environmental Protection Agency is taking the final steps required to issue the second key operating permit. Following a recently bond offering, the capital requirements for commercial production are in hand and final design and engineering of the commercial in-situ production facility, as well as procurement of certain critical components, is under way
