PERTH (miningweekly.com) – More than 1 000 resources jobs were currently available across Queensland, the Queensland Resources Council (QRC) said on Tuesday, proving that despite the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and commodity price fluctuations, the sector continued to hire staff. “The resources sector already supports one in six jobs across the state and is playing a central role in helping Queensland work, earn and employ its way through Covid,” QRC CEO Ian Macfarlane said. “Right now the resources sector is offering more than 1 000 opportunities for Queensland jobseekers, both in Brisbane and in the regions.” Macfarlane said the tireless work of the industry, in partnership with the Queensland government and local councils, to ensure staff, their families and their communities remained safe during Covid-19 had ensured the industry could continue to operate and earn for Queensland. “As an industry, we are working very hard and having increasing success in attracting more women, more Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and more young Queenslanders to join our industry. “The resources and energy sector uses cutting edge technology and is at the forefront of delivering the full energy mix, advanced manufacturing and renewable energy and battery storage technologies, so there is a lot to offer potential employees looking for new opportunities,” he said. “I strongly encourage people who want to be part of an industry that is all about finding energy solutions to consider a career in resources.”
