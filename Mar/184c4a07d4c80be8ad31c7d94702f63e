The former head of electric vehicle (EV) company Tesla’s battery supply chain, Annie Liu, has joined the board of lithium developer Vulcan Energy. Commenting on the appointment, chairperson Gavin Rezos said that Liu had a deep knowledge and understanding of battery supply chains and the lithium marketplace. “Her profound insights into OEM [original-equipment manufacturer] requirements will provide invaluable assistance to the Vulcan board and management,” he said. Vuclan is developing a lithium-rich geothermal brine project in the Upper Rhine Valley of Germany. It is currently Europe’s largest Joint Ore Reserve Committee-compliant lithium resource. Liu said that Vulcan had a ready market on its doorstep with OEMs in close vicinity. “I’m excited to help Vulcan with its premium product branding around zero carbon lithium to meet the EU’s requirements for ethically sourced, sustainable battery metals supplies with a low carbon footprint.” Liu will receive performance rights to the value of $35 000 a year for three years.
