TSX-V- and Aim-listed Altus Strategies has been granted exploration licences for three copper and silver projects totalling 252 km2 in the western Anti-Atlas region of Morocco. Following a competitive tender process, Altus’ subsidiary Aterian Resources was awarded the projects. The projects are considered highly prospective for sediment-hosted copper and silver mineralisation. The latest projects, namely Izougza, Azrar and Tata, have doubled Altus’ landholding in the country to 511 km2 and increased its portfolio to seven base and precious metals projects in Morocco. Remote sensing programmes have identified a number of priority targets which Aterian will soon start exploration work on. The company awaits a grant of further projects that it applied for in Morocco.
