PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold miner Kirkland Lake has launched a A$12-million community partnership programme (CPP) in Bendigo, Victoria, to support the region’s recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. The CPP forms part of Kirland Lake’s greater $20-million donation announced in May last year, to support medical, social and community organisations in the areas of Canada and Australia affected by the pandemic. Community projects in Central Victoria will receive over A$10-million through the CPP over the next three years, with key themes targeting the disadvantaged, education and training, social health and wellbeing, diversity and inclusion, and economic development. Other funds are also earmarked for partnerships near Kirkland Lake Gold’s projects in the Northern Territory. The CPP supports organisations that deliver essential community services and which continue to overcome challenges from the pandemic, including increased services demand. Kirkland Lake VP for Australian operations Ion Hann said the company is proud to support a diversity of projects to assist the community with post-Covid recovery. “Our goal is to make a sustained impact in the partner organisations and the lives of the people they support, leaving a positive legacy for the community.” The CPP is additional to Fosterville gold mine’s annual community grants programme for the Bendigo region, and builds on the A$1-million contribution from Kirkland Lake Gold to regional bushfire relief and recovery in January 2020 and a A$400 000 local fund announced in December 2020.
