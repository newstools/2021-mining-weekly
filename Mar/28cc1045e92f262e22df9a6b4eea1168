LSE-listed Petra Diamonds says it has obtained further information relating to the allegations of human rights abuses at its Williamson mine, in Tanzania. It has, therefore, decided to defer the publication of its feedback on the independent investigation into the alleged human rights abuses until this work has concluded. Petra previously committed to provide feedback on the investigation being carried out by an external adviser, in conjunction with its legal advisers, by the end of March. Petra now expects its report on the investigation to be published by the end of April.
