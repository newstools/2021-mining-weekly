The full executive team of London-listed Vast Resources, including COO Craig Harvey, is on site in Romania to coordinate the implementation of the revised mine plan for its Baita Plai polymetallic mine. The team also includes CEO Andrew Prelea, Vast Baita Plai GM Marcus Brewster, CFO Paul Fletcher and chief commercial officer Andrew Hall. The company previously said that South Africa-based Harvey was unable to be physically present in Romania, owing to Covid-19 restrictions, which made managing the mine more challenging. In January, Vast appointed Brewster as full time mine manager, based in Romania. Vast is implementing a revised mine plan for Baita Plai, incorporating a move away from labour intensive mining methods to a more modern, mechanised mining method. Under the new plan, the company has acquired three additional underground LHDs and a jumbo face drilling rig with long hole capabilities and is awaiting delivery. "The next two weeks should be an enormously constructive period for Vast as we physically assemble the key elements responsible for delivering on our revised and upgraded mine plan at Baita Plai,‚Äù said Prelea. Baita Plai, in the Apuseni mountains, has a Joint Ore Reserve Committee-compliant reserve and resource which underpins an initial mine production life of about three to four years, with an in-situ total mineral resource of 15 695 t of copper equivalent with a further 1.8-million- to three-million-tonne exploration target. The company is now working on confirming an enlarged exploration target of up to 5.8-million tonnes.
