The Minerals Council South Africa has made certain recommendations to member companies in light of the risks that a third Covid-19 wave poses, should infections surge over the Easter long weekend and other upcoming public holidays. The councilâ€™s CEO Zero Harm Forum earlier this month held a special meeting to discuss the potential impact of a third wave, as well as how to manage that risk. It subsequently recommended to member companies that they communicate with employees, contractors and communities about measures to avoid or mitigate a third wave of infections. The council also suggested that employees be discouraged, wherever possible, from travelling over Easter, with CEOs and management seen to be leading by example. The Minerals Council urged that public holiday work incentives be used to encourage employees not to take leave over the long weekend. Companies have been asked to rather offer employees leave days later in the year. The council further stressed to members that they should step up return-to-work screening and testing procedures during this period to reduce the risk of employees, who have been travelling, starting a new wave of workplace transmissions.
