A contractor employee died at the Cozamin mine, in Mexico, on Sunday, following an underground accident. Toronto-listed Capstone Mining said the contractor employee was pinned by a rockfall from the drill face. He was treated by the site emergency response team and transported to Zacatecas hospital, where he passed away. Operations at the copper/silver mine were temporarily suspended, but were set to resume on Monday afternoon.
