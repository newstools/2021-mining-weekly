London-listed Petra Diamonds in January sold the 299.3 ct diamond recovered at the Cullinan diamond mine, in South Africa, to Stargems DMCC for $12.18-million. The exceptional Type 11a white gem-quality diamond adds to the most famous diamonds that have originated from the historic Cullinan mine. The diamond achieved a price of $40 701/ct, which exceeds the $34 386/ct received for the 424.89 ct 'Legacy of the Cullinan Diamond Mine' in May 2019. “This is another significant sale for Petra Diamonds, following the sale of the Letlapa Tala Collection in November 2020, and a further endorsement of the quality of the Cullinan orebody which is known for its exceptional stones,” Petra CEO Richard Duffy comments.
