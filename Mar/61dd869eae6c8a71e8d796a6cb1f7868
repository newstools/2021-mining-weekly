Aim-listed BlueRock Diamonds has recovered three large gem-quality diamonds at its Kareevlei mine, in the Kimberley region of South Africa. The diamonds weigh 10.6 ct, 9.8 ct and 8.4 ct. “I am very encouraged by the recovery of these three high-value gem-quality diamonds following the sale of a 14.8 ct diamond for $167 000 in January. "The average price that we have received for the first two months of 2021 was an excellent $423/ct and I look forward to updating the market on the results of the March tender, when we publish our quarterly report in early April,” comments BlueRock chairperson Mike Houston.
