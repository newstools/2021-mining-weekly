Rick Menell has resigned as nonexecutive director and deputy chairperson of Gold Fields, with effect from March 10. His resignation follows a successful tenure of 13 years as a nonexecutive director of the company. Menell led the recent CEO succession process on behalf of the Gold Fields board, which was concluded earlier this year. Gold Fields in January announced that Chris Griffth would succeed Nick Holland as CEO, from April 1. Gold Fields says he decided to step down after the completion of this process to allow the company to refresh its directorate in the interest of good governance. "Gold Fields would like to thank MrÂ Menell for his contributions and guidance to the board during his tenure," the company adds.
