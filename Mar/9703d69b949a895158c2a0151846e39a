The National Environment Management Council of Tanzania has approved Aim-listed Armadale Capital’s environmental- and social-impact assessment for the production of natural flake graphite from the Mahenge Liandu graphite project. The company has now submitted its mining licence application to the country’s Department of Energy and Minerals. Armadale has made considerable progress over this past year continually taking steps forward in derisking Mahenge Liandu to advance through development towards production at a time where global demand for graphite products is set to rise exponentially, especially in spherical graphite manufacturing for the electric vehicle market. “A great deal of important work is being carried out in individual workstreams relating to testing, offtake, financing and the detailed design engineering and this will continue throughout 2021. “We look forward to updating shareholders across workstreams with regularity throughout the year at a time where there is considerable focus and demand by high-quality graphite projects,” says chairperson Nick Johansen.
