SANTIAGO â€“ Chile's SQM, the world's No.2 lithium producer, said on Thursday it hoped to soon double its goal of expanding production of lithium hydroxide from 30 000 t to 60 000 t as demand for the electric vehicle battery metal soars. CEO Ricardo Ramos said in a call with analysts that the company's already announced intentions to expand production capacity to 30 000 t of lithium hydroxide was "not enough." He said the company now had the technology to produce "very low cost" and "high quality" product.
