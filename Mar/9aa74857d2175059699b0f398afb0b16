Ecuador-focused Lundin Gold has started its 9 000 m regional exploration drill programme, with the first drill hole now in progress on the Barbasco target. The regional exploration programme will focus on two high-priority targets – Barbasco and Puente-Princesa – to test for mineralisation in a geological setting similar to that of its Fruta del Norte mine. CEO Ron Hochstein says it is Lundin’s objective to find another Fruta del Norte-style deposit. “The target’s geochemistry, alteration and geology fits the Suarez basin exploration model that led to the discovery of Fruta del Norte in 2006 and has been refined since then,” he says. The Barbasco target, which is Lundin’s highest priority target, is about 7 km south of the Fruta del Norte mine.
