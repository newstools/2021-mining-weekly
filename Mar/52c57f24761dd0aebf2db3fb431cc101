PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Natural graphite production has restarted at the Balama operations, in Mozambique. ASX-listed Syrah Resources on Tuesday reported that the company had achieved consistent production of on-specification natural graphite at Balama during March, positioning the operation ahead of schedule for first production. Syrah in February announced plans to restart operations at Balama, after operations were suspended in March of last year owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. “During the period of temporary suspension at Balama, we reduced costs while also maintaining operating and marketing capability to ensure that we could promptly respond to an improvement in market conditions,” said Syrah MD and CEO Shaun Verner. “Our re-start progress to date is a testament to the ongoing preparedness work by the Balama operations team during the temporary suspension and positions us well to ramp up into improving market demand.” The company will progressively increase plant use and production volumes at Balama as the full contingent of labour at the mine continues to be reinstated.
