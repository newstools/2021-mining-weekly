Former BHP CEO Andrew Mackenzie has been named chairperson of the energy major Royal Dutch Shell. He will replace Chad Holliday on May 18, when he steps down after having served as chairperson for six years and as a director since 2020. Shell said that the successful candidate not only required proven experience of leading a large, complex international organisation, but also significant experience in capital discipline and an ability to balance and judge the timing of transformation changes that the group would have to make. “Andrew brings a wealth of leadership and sustainability experience, scientific curiosity and commercial acumen that ideally equip him to help Shell navigate the energy transition and deliver on the far-reaching Powering Progress strategy. His track record in business performance transformation also means he brings all the skills and rigour needed to guide Shell’s management in all their most significant decisions,” said Holliday of his successor. Mackenzie handed over the CEO role at BHP in January 2020, with Mike Henry now leading that organisation. Further, Shell announced that nonexecutive director and chair of the safety, environment and succession committee, Nigel Sheinwald, would not stand for re-election at the 2021 annual general meeting. The group would put forward Jane Lute for election to the board.
