Quebec graphite mine developer Nouveau Monde has applied for a listing of its shares on the NYSE, as the company moves to bolster its global visibility. The Pallinghurst Group-backed company, which is developing the Matawinie graphite mine, currently trades on the TSX-V. Chairperson Arne Frandsen previously said that Nouveau Monde aimed to bolster its presence in the US, as it sought to execute on its strategy of becoming the western worldâ€™s largest producer of high-quality anode materials. Further, Nouveau Monde stated that it had filed a preliminary short form base shelf prospectus with the securities regulatory authorities in each of the provinces of Canada. Once obtained, this would enable the company to offer for sale and issue up to $500-million of common shares, subscription receipts, debt securities warrants and units, or any combination thereof from time to time during the 25-month period during which the shelf prospectus remained valid.
