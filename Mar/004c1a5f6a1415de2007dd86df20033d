Shukhrat Ibragimov has been appointed to Eurasian Resources Group’s (ERG’s) board of managers with effect from March 3. Ibragimov will also serve as a member of the board’s audit committee, remuneration committee and the sustainable development and mergers and acquisitions committees. He takes over from his father, Alijan Ibragimov, a co-founder of ERG who passed away in February. Prior to his appointment to the board, Ibragimov served as ERG’s business development head for over six years, and the company says he was “instrumental in developing and launching some of the group’s most ambitious international projects”, including Metalkol RTR, the world’s second largest standalone producer of cobalt and a major producer of copper, and BAMIN, ERG’s integrated mining and logistics project in Brazil.
