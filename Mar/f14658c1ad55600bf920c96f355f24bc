JSE-listed Eastern Platinum (Eastplats) has completed all the necessary reconfiguration and optimisation work at its small-scale platinum group metals (PGMs) circuit in the Bushveld Complex. The small-scale circuit, or PGM Circuit D and previously “scavenger plant circuit”, forms part of a restart process for the main PGM plant circuit. The small-scale plant has, since March 23, started dispatching PGM concentrate. The company completed the upgrades to obtain higher-quality concentrate to be able to consistently produce a minimum 200 t of PGMs concentrate a month. This is expected to have a positive impact on the company’s revenue. PGM Circuit D uses the initial work on the PGM Main Circuit. The next phase of the PGM Main Circuit work is on track to start in May, with commissioning expected in October. Restarting the main circuit will add a further 800 t a month of PGMs concentrate to production. CEO Diana Hu says Eastplats is ramping up its PGMs production at a time of increasing demand and rising PGMs pricing. “Several countries recently legislated new curbs on pollution from gasoline and diesel engines, boosting the use of PGMs in autocatalysts, the largest application of PGMs.”
