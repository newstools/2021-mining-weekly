PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Major BHP on Monday announced that it has partnered with the Commonwealth Department of Education, Skills and Employment to create up to 1 000 new training opportunities in regional Australia. BHP will invest A$30-million in the Future of Work programme, which will help strengthen economic resilience in regional communities through advanced apprenticeships, skills and short-course training opportunities, targeted to address the specific needs of local workforces and small businesses. The Future of Work program will work with relevant organisations and groups to identify local workforce and business needs in regional areas, and tailor training opportunities accordingly. “BHP is supporting a business-led recovery through our ongoing operations and significant investments in regional Australia. We will help Australia bounce back by creating new opportunities for regional jobseekers and economies,” BHP president for Minerals Australia Edgar Basto said. “The advanced apprenticeships and short courses offered by the Future of Work programme will help develop the workforce of the future. Australians will be able to re-skill, embrace technology and find new jobs in many sectors, not just mining. We are proud to play our part in helping Australian communities on the road to recovery.” BHP employs about 45 000 people in Australia, and last financial year delivered more than A$33-billion in value to the national economy. In October last year, the company pledged to create 3 500 new apprentice and training positions, and boost business opportunities for Australian mining equipment and technology services sector companies, with an investment of nearly A$800-million over the next five years.
