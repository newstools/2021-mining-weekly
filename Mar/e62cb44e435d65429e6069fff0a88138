Northern Ireland gold producer and explorer Galantas Gold has restarted underground blasting, although it remains limited by the availability of cash resources. Development mining of the Kearney gold vein at the Omagh gold mine will produce a feed of higher gold grade for the processing plant than the current feed, the TSX-V and Aim-listed miner said on Friday. “Cash constraints do restrict how quickly operations can be expanded and the company is actively working with third parties on the arrangements required both to expand blasting underground and to expand exploration, for which significant potential exists,” said president and CEO Roland Phelps. Development mining started on a single-shift basis, using a single existing equipment suite. Galantas cautioned that operating performance might be reduced in the event of any breakdowns and the issues surrounding Brexit might impact on the restocking of specialist blasting material. Galantas last month reached a deal with the local police, PSNI, to expand blasting at Omagh. Under the previous arrangement, the company has completed 2 km of underground development.
