PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Iron-ore major Fortescue Metals has unveiled a A$25-million investment to create some 200 new traineeship positions across its operations. The miner on Wednesday said that the traineeship positions would cover a range of new entry-level positions across autonomous operations, safety, business administration, human resources, operations and hospitality. The recruitment drive is targeted at diverse local candidates who have never worked in the mining sector. “The West Australian mining sector continues to play a significant role in Australia’s economic recovery, employing thousands of people and making a substantial contribution to the state and national economies through the payment of taxes and royalties,” said Fortescue CEO Elizabeth Gaines. “In line with our commitment to ensuring communities benefit from our growth and development, we are providing new training and employment opportunities for West Australians while also investing in the future of our workforce by ensuring there is a sustainable pipeline of talent with the necessary skills to support our business.” Fortescue employs around 15 000 people and in 2020 made a total economic contribution of A$17.3-billion through jobs, payments to suppliers, dividends to shareholders, taxes, royalties and community investment.
