PERTH (miningweekly.com) – A new report by the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies (Amec) has been launched showcasing Australia’s critical minerals potential. “The document is a visual showcase of Australia’s outstanding critical minerals projects to attract investment to our emerging critical minerals sector and is timely with today’s announcement of the Modern Manufacturing Initiative by the Prime Minister,” said Amec CEO Warren Pearce.

“Continuing the trend of the last few years, there is a growing investment interest for renewable sources of energy, particularly those offered by Australia’s vast critical minerals potential.”

“The announcement by the Prime Minister for an investment of A$1.3-billion to downstream processing and manufacturing recognises the importance of developing Australia’s abundant critical minerals projects.”  

Pearce said that on the back of exponential growth in global demand for renewable batteries and other downstream critical minerals offerings, the Australian governments were seeking to diversify and expand local supply chains, starting with exploration and mining projects identified in this document.

Designed to pique investor interest in the emerging market, Amec’s document identifies 48 of Australia’s key critical minerals projects, from greenfield exploration to those nearing development, across a wide range of critical minerals.

“The opportunity for investment is ripe. Amec’s previous iterations of the document have already attracted domestic and international interest to these projects located all around Australia. Along with our planned translation of the document into languages targeting key foreign investors, we expect today’s document launch to spur further investor interest,” said Pearce.
