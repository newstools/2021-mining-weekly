TSX-V-listed Stellar AfricaGold has completed an independent technical report on the potential of the Tichka Est gold project, in Morocco. CEO John Cumming says the report presents a summary of the available technical data from previous exploration activities conducted by the Moroccan State-owned Office National des Hydrocarbures et des Mines (Onhym) on the project. The report also includes the results of the due diligence validation programme completed by Stellar in June last year. Cumming points out that, although six anomalous gold zones were outlined by Onhym stream sediments programmes, and confirmed by Stellar’s due diligence sampling, zones A and B warrant priority attention. The Zone A prospect was outlined by a cluster of 85 anomalous gold-in-stream sediment samples over an area of 27 km2 with assay values ranging from 0.021 g/t to 17.06 g/t gold. The zone contains nine trenches distributed at regular intervals along a strike length of 400 m. The Zone B prospect was outlined by 27 anomalous stream sediment samples with grades ranging from 0.033 g/t to 22.33 g/t gold, over an area of 6.3 km2. Stellar says the area contains ten trenches excavated across the structure over a strike length of 300 m. Cumming notes that the two prospects, individually, have the potential to be significant gold resources, if mineralisation extends vertically and laterally with similar characteristics. The technical report recommends that a 2 000 m reverse circulation programme be conducted to test the horizontal and vertical extension of the surface mineralised structures.
