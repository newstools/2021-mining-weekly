PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX- and TSX-V listed Tempus Resources has flagged the resignation of MD Brendan Borg. The company said on Friday that the effective date of Borg’s resignation would be confirmed following an appropriate transition period. Borg’s resignation follows shortly after the recruitment of Vacouver-based president Jason Bahnsen, and the appointment of two Canadian directors to the Tempus board, Tom Peregoodoff and Anthony Cina. “Under Borg’s leadership, the company moved through a number of significant milestones including the initial listing on the ASX, acquisition of our flagship gold projects in Canada and Ecuador, completion of various physical exploration programmes and the listing on the TSX Venture Exchange,” said chairperson Alexander Molyneux. “With the focus of operations now in the Americas, it makes sense to consolidate management there. On behalf of Tempus’ stakeholders, I would very much like to thank Borg as a co-founding director for his substantial contributions and to wish him well in his future endeavours.”
