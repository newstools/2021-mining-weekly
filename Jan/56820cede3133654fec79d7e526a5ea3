Canadian miner Pretium Resources (Pretivm) has reported gold production of 347 743 oz, which is slightly above the midpoint of its target range, and in line with what the company expects to produce this year. Meeting its production target was a company first, with CEO Jacques Perron noting that it was the first time in Pretivm’s history that it has achieved its yearly production guidance. “[This] demonstrates the hard work and perseverance of our team in light of the exceptional challenges we faced this year,” he said in a statement on Monday. In 2020, the Brucejack mine, in British Columbia, produced at an average grade of 8.5 g/t and an average gold recovery of 97%. In the fourth quarter, Brucejack produced 88 299 oz of gold at an average grade of 8.9 g/t . The company ramped-up to an average processing rate of 3 800 g/d in the month of December. Pretivm’s guidance for 2021 is to produce 325 000 oz to 365 000 oz, with a midpoint of 345 000 oz, at an all-in sustaining cost of $1 060/oz to $1 190/oz. An average grade of 7.5 g/t to 8.5 g/t is targeted.
