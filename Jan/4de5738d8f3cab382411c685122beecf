PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Mining major BHP plans to construct a wind fence at Finucane Island, as part of its Pilbara Air Quality Program. The fence would be the first of its kind in Australia, and would be designed for the Pilbara’s unique weather conditions, said BHP Port GM Nilson Davila. “We recognise we have a shared responsibility to address dust issues at Port Hedland. The wind fence will be constructed using global best practice dust management and air quality control technology. “This planned investment forms part of our Pilbara Air Quality Program and demonstrates our commitment to improve air quality in the area and contribute to the revitalisation of the West End. “Subject to government approvals, the 30 m high fence supports our intention to improve and build on our existing dust control measures as we continue to increase production towards 290-million tons a year in the medium term.” The fence will be located on the western side of BHP’s Finucane Island port operations, and will include mesh panels designed to reduce wind speeds, shielding the stockyard and reducing the potential for dust lift-off. The system has been designed to deal with the extreme wind conditions often experienced in Port Hedland. As the wind speed reaches a certain limit, the mesh curtain opens, to let the air flow through the fence. “We continue to work closely with government, industry and the local community to further improve air quality controls at our operations and for the communities in which we operate. We want to help improve local amenity while also continuing to provide jobs and economic opportunity for the region,” said Davila. The project is still subject to all necessary internal and state government approvals.
