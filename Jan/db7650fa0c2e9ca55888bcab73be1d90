State-owned power utility Eskom has advised that Stage 2 load-shedding will be implemented from midday on January 14 through to the end of January 17. Eskom says the load-shedding is necessary owing to two tripped generation units at the Kusile power station, as a result of failure of the main coal feed conveyor belts supplying coal to the units. Additionally, two units experienced unforeseen breakdowns at the Kriel and Duvha power stations. Eskom also has four generation units whose return to service from planned maintenance has been delayed. About 5.3 GW of capacity is on planned maintenance, while 14.7 GW of capacity is unavailable owing to breakdowns and unplanned maintenance.
