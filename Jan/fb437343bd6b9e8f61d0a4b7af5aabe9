Gold miner DRDGold nonexecutive chairperson Geoffrey Campbell will not stand for re-election to the board when his current contract expires on November 30. Announcing the decision on Tuesday, Campbell said that DRDGold’s attention was focused on Southern Africa, and as a subsidiary of Sibanye-Stillwater, there was little rationale for a UK-based chairperson. Accordingly, his tenure as director and chairperson would come to an end with effect from December 1. “November would be a natural time to hand over,” he commented in a statement. “I have been a director since June 2002 and it has been an amazing journey. Together, we have built a very successful and socially responsible company of which we can all be very proud.” Since taking up the role of chairperson in 2006, Campbell has overseen the successful disposal of DRDGold’s subsidiary, Emperor Mines, and guided the company in its transition from a predominantly deep-level underground gold miner to a leading surface recycling enterprise, paying a dividend to shareholders for 13 uninterrupted years and with a keen focus on social and environmental value. Campbell’s crowning achievement was the successful acquisition of the Far West Gold Operations in 2019 and the 680% surge in the company’s market capitalisation for the financial year ended June 30 2020, earning it the coveted number one spot in the Sunday Times 100 Top Companies Award in 2020.
