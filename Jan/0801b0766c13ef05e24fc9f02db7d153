LSE-listed rare earth and magnet metals developer Pensana Rare Earths plans to delist from the ASX. It has requested a trading halt while it makes an application to the ASX about the proposed delisting. The company will, however, maintain its primary listing on the main board of the LSE. Pensana is developing the Longonjo project, in Angola. The project contains about 4.47-million tonnes of rare earth oxides, including 990 000 t of neodymium and praseodymium.
