Canadian gold miner Centerra Gold has entered into a new $400-million four-year revolving credit facility, replacing its previous $500-million revolving credit facility, as well as a $200-million accordion feature. The credit facility is led by the Bank of Nova Scotia, National Bank Financial Markets and HSBC Canada Bank. It is supported by a syndicate of international financial institutions. Centerra says the facility remains undrawn and it may be used for working capital, investments, acquisitions and capital expenditure, providing future flexibility and reducing the company’s financing costs.
