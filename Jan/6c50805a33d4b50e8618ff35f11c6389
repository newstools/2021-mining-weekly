The Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) reports its “dismay” following the fatality of a mineworker and the injury of another, reportedly at Harmony Gold's Bambanani shaft, in the Free State, on January 13. This, reports AMCU, is on the back of a previous fatality at Sibanye-Stillwater's Kloof mine on January 8. “We await further details in this regard,” states AMCU, which adds that 2021 “has not begun well”. AMCU says an investigation is under way to determine how and why the incident at Bambanani occurred, but says a fall of ground is believed to have occurred, subsequently trapping two rock drill operators underground. Consequent to this, both mineworkers were located and recovered with one being declared dead at the scene, while the survivor was rushed to the hospital.
