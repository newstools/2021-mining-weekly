UK-based law firm Leigh Day has confirmed in a statement that global diversified miner Vedanta Resources has agreed to pay a settlement for all claims brought against it by Zambian claimants related to alleged pollution around the Konkola Copper Mines (KCM) operations. Without admission of liability, Vedanta and KCM have agreed to settle claims brought by about 2 000 Zambian villagers in 2015, for the benefit of local communities. The claimants alleged that the pollution from the Nchanga copper mine, run by KCM, severely impacted the lives of people living in nearby villages, where the primary source of income is farming and fishing. Leigh Day, as the solicitors, said it was claimed that toxic effluent discharge from the mine damaged local land and waterways used for irrigation and the use of polluted water for drinking, washing and bathing caused residents severe health problems. The UK Supreme Court judges ruled in April 2019 that the case could be brought against Vedanta in the English courts because, as the parent company of KCM, the company arguably owed the villagers duty of care. The defendants initially challenged the jurisdiction of the English courts, filing applications which sought a declaration that the court does not have jurisdiction to try the claims. The Supreme Court agreed with arguments advanced by the claimants that there was a real risk they would not be able to achieve justice in the Zambian courts owing to lack of funding and legal expertise available. The court further ruled that Vedanta had published material asserting its responsibility for the establishment of group-wide environmental control and sustainability standards and therefore must be held accountable for such statements.
