Mineral exploration and development company Global Li-Ion Graphite (Lion) is moving closer to restarting graphite production in Madagascar, where it owns the Ambato-Arana project. The Vancouver-based company said this week that it aimed to restart graphite production during the course of 2021. Lion is currently finalising its mine development plan which had been slowed, though not stopped, during Covid-19 lockdowns in Madagascar. The plan would get existing mines that were currently on care and maintenance back into commercial production. Lion’s licences are in the vicinity of Andasibe in Toamasina province, about 20 km to the north-east of Sheritt’s Ambatovy nickel/cobalt laterite openpit mine.
