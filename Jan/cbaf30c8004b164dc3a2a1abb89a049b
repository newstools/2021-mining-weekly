PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Laneway Resources has reported its first gold pour at its Agate Creek gold mine, in Queensland, from its current mining campaign. “We are pleased to achieve the first gold pour from the current mining campaign and look forward to the completion of the processing of the ore that is currently at the Lorena processing plant,” said Laneway chairperson Stephen Bizzell. The company on Wednesday said that an initial 3.2 kg gold dore bar had been poured at the Lorena gold mine carbon-in-leach (CIL) processing plant, sourced only from the first strips of gold recovered to CIL carbon to date from the ore being processed. Gold recovered from the gravity and intensive leach reactor circuits is still to be electrowon and would be prepared for a separate pour. Some 4 400 t of ore, grading 6 g/t gold has been transported to the Lorena processing plant, with some 2 200 t of ore having been crushed to date and fed into the plant. Laneway said on Wednesday that mining operations at Agate Creek continue to be suspended owing to localized flooding and resultant road closure, which is likely to see the suspension of mining until after the wet season. “While mining activities continue to be temporarily suspended due to the recent heavy rainfall and flooding, the company continues to progress other activities in preparation for a busy 2021 as we focus in parallel on the planning, approvals and development of the larger volume of high-grade ore encompassed by the larger Whittle pit shell, undertake drilling programmes targeting over 60 regional exploration targets, and then turn our attention to options for on-site processing of the almost half-a-million ounces of gold resource already identified at Agate Creek,” said Bizzell.
