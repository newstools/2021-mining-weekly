TSX-V-listed fertiliser development company Gensource Potash Corporation has advised that Alton Anderson will transition to the role of CFO, effective April 1. He joined the company on January 1 to transition into the role. Anderson succeeds Rob Theoret, who co-founded the company and will be assuming the role of VP for corporate finance and business development. Gensource says Anderson brings a broad range of financial management expertise and project and business management acumen to the company. “His achievements and background in finance and business operations gained over his 30-year career in the fertiliser industry will be extremely beneficial as we continue to build the company and implement processes and procedures for project execution and long-term operations.” Anderson’s 30 years of experience in the fertiliser industry include 22 years at PotashCorp and Nutrien, while he also holds a commerce degree and is a Chartered Professional Accountant. With the company’s Tugaske project, in Saskatchewan, progressing towards financial close, leading to construction, Theoret will focus on Gensource’s business plan of developing additional projects and finding additional business opportunities within the fertilizer sector.
