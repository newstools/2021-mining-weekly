Toronto-listed Nevada Copper has upsized its bought-deal public offering following strong investor demand. The company on Monday announced a C$21.5-million offering to bolster its balance sheet to complete the ramp-up of its Pumpkin Hollow underground project, in the US, but on Tuesday increased this to C$33-million. The company amended an agreement with Scotiabank pursuant to which underwriters have agreed to buy, on a bought deal basis, 200-million units at C$0.165 each.
