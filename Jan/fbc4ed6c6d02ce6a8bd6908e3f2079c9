TSX-V-listed Diamcor Mining is making “considerable progress” in increasing processing volumes, diamond recoveries and revenues since having resumed operations. Its Krone-Endora at Venetia mine, in South Africa's Limpopo province, had been shuttered for most of 2020 amid Covid-19-related restrictions. However, from December 2020 through to January 20, 2021, the company delivered 4 174.36 ct of rough diamonds for tender and sale. Tailings processed during the initial restart of the processing plant yielded 666.75 ct of rough diamonds, generating gross revenues of $79 000, equivalent to $118.49/ct. The subsequent processing of quarry material has now resumed and 1 452.73 ct of rough diamonds from initial exercises were tendered and sold, generating gross revenues of $266 705, resulting in an average price of $183.59/ct. An additional 2 054.88 ct of rough diamonds from the processing of quarry material were also delivered as of January 20, 2021, which are scheduled to be tendered and sold in Dubai early next month. Diamcor is targeting a further increase in processing volumes starting in February 2021 with the commissioning of several planned operational refinements.
