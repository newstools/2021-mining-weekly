JSE-listed engineering and construction group Murray & Roberts reports that its subsidiary, construction and engineering company Clough, has been awarded a A$400-million contract for an engineering, procurement and construction scope of work on the Waitsia Stage 2 development project in Western Australia. Cloughâ€™s scope of work relates to a gas processing plant, including power generation. The Stage 2 project includes a new 250 TJ/d gas processing plant with a 20-year life cycle that will convey gas through the nearby Dampier to Bunbury natural gas pipeline. The project is being coordinated by Waitsia joint venture partners Mitsui E&P Australia and Beach Energy. The Waitsia gasfield is ranked as one of the largest gasfields ever discovered onshore in Australia and it is forecast to bring significant economic benefits to the midwest region of the country from both the construction and operating phases. Clough and the client have worked together for the past two years to enhance the project's design. The project is set to commence during the first quarter of this year and will bring significant economic benefits to the region.
