Aim-listed Panthera Resources says preliminary results from recent exploration at the Bassala gold project, in Mali, suggest a large exploration target with over 8 km strike potential. Providing an update on its West African exploration programmes, as well as for the projects owned by its associated company Moydow Holdings, Panthera MD Mark Bolton notes that, at Bassala, a strong correlation between the structural targets identified by the ground magnetic survey with a gold-in-soil anomaly suggests that this may be a large gold exploration. Further, first-pass drilling at the Paimasa project, in Nigeria, has been completed, with initial assay results expected in the first quarter of this year. Paimasa is held under a joint venture agreement between Moydow and PW Nigeria Mining. In addition, at Labola in Burkina Faso, Moydow's team is currently preparing detailed plans and processes for a drilling programme that is expected to start this quarter. Several further additional targets at various stages of exploration have also been identified. "We enter 2021 in good stead, with teams having conducted extensive activity across the West African licences over the Christmas/New Year period. "Panthera has a firm operational platform with which to commence the new year and to continue to grow from strength to strength on our efforts of 2020,” says Bolton.
