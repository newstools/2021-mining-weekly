Positive results from an ongoing exploration drilling programme at TSX-V-listed African Gold Group’s Kobada project, in Mali, have highlighted the continuity of the mineralisation at depth beneath the current pit design and indicate that there is a presence of high grades to support potential future underground mining. The drill programme has extended the depth of the oxide-sulphide boundary from an anticipated 110 m to 180 m at the northern extensions of the main shear zone, representing an increase of about 60%. To date, the company has drilled 6 258 m of the combined diamond and reverse circulation drilling, with encouraging results continuing to show deeper-than-anticipated extensions of the orebody at depth, as well as additional mineralised zones outside of the known ore zones. African Gold’s key internal goal for the first quarter of this year is to further demonstrate the considerable potential for an increased resource base at the Kobada gold project, as the company expects to incorporate the results of the drilling programme in the next mineral resource estimate update to be published early in 2021. CEO Danny Callow says that, based on the results of the drilling campaign, the company will extend the drilling in the Phase 4 infill drilling campaign, as well as look to start to drill the extension of the main shear zone as a Phase 5 programme. The 2021 drilling programme is focused on the newly identified shear zones at the Kobada, Faraba and Kobada Est concessions (Phase 3), and a conversion of the inferred resources to the measured and indicated category, with the goal of expanding the reserve base to over one-million ounces as part of Phase 4. Strike extension of the main shear zone at Kobada concession will comprise Phase 5.
