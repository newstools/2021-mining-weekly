PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Diamond miner Lucapa has recovered a 113 ct gem-quality diamond from its Lulo alluvial mine, in Angola. The ASX-listed miner on Monday said that this was the first diamond of more than 100 ct recovered from Mining Block 46, which is immediately downstream of the Canguige river, but was the seventeenth stone of more than 100 ct recovered at Lulo. The miner told shareholders that the recovery boded well for the coming months, as mining at Lulo would focus on the southern terrace mining blocks during the wet season.
