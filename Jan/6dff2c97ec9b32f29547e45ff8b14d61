Canadian resource company Goldsource Mines has recorded additional 2020 expansion and in-fill drill results for the Eagle Mountain deposit, as well as a new gold discovery at the Ann prospect. Both the Eagle Mountain deposit and Ann prospect are located within the Eagle Mountain gold project in Guyana. Newly reported results are for 11 core holes totalling 1 839 m. About 16 300 m of core drilling was completed in 2020. An estimated 34 000 m of drilling has been completed in the last three drill seasons at Eagle Mountain with a cut-off date for drill results of November 7, 2020, to be used in the Mineral Resource Estimation update to be announced early this year. At the Eagle Mountain gold deposit – Baboon area, drill holes EME20-72 and EME20-73 have confirmed the expansion of three near-surface sub-horizontal gold mineralised zones (zones 1 to 3) to the southwest of the Eagle Mountain deposit. At the Eagle Mountain gold deposit – Kilroy area, highlight drill hole EMM20-001 intersected 54 m grading 1.72 g/t gold, including a higher-grade sub-interval of 12 m grading 6.91 g/t gold. In-fill drill results at the Kilroy area support the historical results and the continuity of mineralisation, including the presence of multiple sub-horizontal gold mineralised zones. At the Ann prospect – Minnehaha area, highlight drill hole EME20-081 exhibits similar characteristics to mineralised breccias in Salbora and Toucan with a breccia interval of 3 m grading 5.40 g/t gold. Moreover, highlight drill hole EME-20-079 intersected 11.5 m grading 3.37 g/t gold from surface, including a higher-grade sub-interval of 7.5 m grading 5.21 g/t gold starting at 4 m and hosted in unconsolidated near-surface material. The company’s exploration programme in 2020 was designed to expand and confirm the continuity of mineralisation of the Eagle Mountain and Salbora deposits for an updated mineral resource and to make additional discoveries within the broader area of Eagle Mountain. “The latest results, once again, deliver on the 2020 objectives both in terms of demonstrating scope for further strike extensions at Eagle Mountain and in showcasing the prospectivity of the project with a new discovery, the Ann prospect,” notes Goldsource CEO Steve Parsons. In January, there will be three core drills operating at Eagle Mountain. Initially, these drill rigs are completing expansion holes for the Toucan and Ann prospects and in-fill holes for the Eagle Mountain deposit.
