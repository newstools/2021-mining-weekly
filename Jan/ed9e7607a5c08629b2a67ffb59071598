Diversified miner Exxaro’s board of directors has approved the appointment of independent nonexecutive director Chanda Nxumalo, effective February 1. She has 15 years of experience in the renewable energy and power sector, having worked across North America and Europe gaining experience in delivering technical, commercial and environmental advisory services in the renewables sector. Nxumalo holds an honours degree in mechanical engineering, economics and management from the University of Oxford. As a director of Harmattan Renewables, she has been responsible for providing technical consultancy and asset management services for renewable energy projects across sub-Saharan Africa. For the past decade, Exxaro states, Nxumalo has been “instrumental in driving” the renewable energy roll-out in South Africa, acting as the spokesperson for the South African Photovoltaic Association, as well as consulting on some of the first renewable projects to be delivered as part of South Africa’s Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme. “With her richness of skills and experience in the energy field, both nationally and internationally, including the African continent, and strong leadership capability, Nxumalo will support Exxaro’s growth strategy in energy,” states Exxaro.
