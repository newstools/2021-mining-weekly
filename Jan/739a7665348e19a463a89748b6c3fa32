The Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) has confirmed the suitability of natural flake graphite from Aim-listed Armadale Capitalâ€™s Mahenge graphite project, in Tanzania, to be used in lithium-ion batteries. The company has been collaborating with CSIRO on testwork to confirm the Mahenge natural flake graphite as a premium-quality product, with exceptional high purity and characteristics necessary for the lithium-ion battery market. Armadale chairperson Nick Johansen says a great deal of technical analysis and testing had been carried out during this initial phase of testwork on the project and that more advanced levels of testwork can now be done, including micronising and classification, spheronising; and electrode fabrication and testing. He adds that these kinds of confirmations put the company in good stead with potential offtakers, which have already been initiated. The company aims to finalise project financing this year. Armadale believes that, as demand continues to increase for green economy-type technology, the demand for graphite will also continue to grow exponentially.
