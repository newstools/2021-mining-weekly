TSX-listed Euro Sun Mining (ESM) has elected Peter Vukanovich as nonexecutive chairperson. Vukanovich is considered an entrepreneurial leader and an experienced board member. He joined the ESM board of directors in July 2020, and currently leads advisory consultancy PMV Consulting. Meanwhile, the company and its key engineering consultants continue to make progress towards completion of the definitive feasibility study (DFS) for the Rovina Valley project, in Romania, as well as ongoing submittals to support the required permitting path for construction. The global Covid-19 pandemic has made it more difficult to finalise the DFS, ESM said on January 6, noting that the company now expects completion of the DFS during the first quarter of this year. In the interim, however, ESM continues to progress all permitting for the project in a timely manner and in conjunction with all Romanian laws. “While the gold price has performed well since our preliminary economic assessment of 2019, we would like to highlight that copper prices are trending higher and should have a positive impact on the DFS given the large size and highly recoverable nature of copper in the Colnic and Rovina deposits,” ESM president and CEO Scott Moore commented.
