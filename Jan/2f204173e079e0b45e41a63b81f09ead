Fresnillo forecast lower gold output for the current year than Covid-hit 2020 on Wednesday, mainly due to a land slip at its Noche Buena mine in Mexico. The precious metals miner, which owns seven operating mines in Mexico, said it produced 769 600 oz of gold in the full-year ended December 31, down from 875 900 oz in the previous year, hit by pandemic-related restrictions.
