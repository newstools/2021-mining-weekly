TSX-V-listed Aton Resources has announced the appointment of Dr Sherif Sousa as its new Egypt country manager. Sousa’s career in Egypt’s oil, gas and mining industries spans more than 40 years. He was the first chairperson of the Egyptian Mineral Resources Authority and was instrumental in the agreement and development of Centamin’s Sukari gold mine. “It is an honour and a privilege in having Dr. Sherif Sousa join Aton in the important role of our country manager in Egypt. It also shows his belief in Aton and its ability to achieve success,” said Aton president and CEO Mark Campbell. Aton is focused on the Abu Marawat concession, about 200 km north of the Sukari gold mine.
