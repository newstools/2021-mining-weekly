PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Potash developer Salt Lake Potash is nearing project completion at its Lake Way project, in Western Australia. The company on Monday told shareholders that the process plant construction was some 88% complete at the end of December, with the overall project completion, including all on-lake infrastructure, now some 81% complete. “Significant progress was made in a challenging environment in 2020 with minimal impact on the project, and we now look forward to supplying the domestic and global agricultural industries with premium sulphate of potash (SoP) in the second quarter of 2021,” said Salt Lake CEO Tony Swiericzuk. Lake Way is expected to produce 245 000 t/y of SoP over a mine life of 20 years, based on the high grade probable ore reserve of 5.4-million tonnes SoP.
