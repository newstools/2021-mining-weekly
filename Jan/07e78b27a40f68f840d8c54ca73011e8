TSX-listed Victoria Gold produced 42 174 oz of gold in the fourth quarter of 2020, taking production for the first six months of operations to 77 748 oz, ahead of guidance of between 72 000 oz and 77 000 oz. “[The] Eagle gold mine had a strong finish to the year, with a solid fourth-quarter operational performance. "Ore placement on the heap leach pad increased by more than 20% quarter-on-quarter including over one-million tonnes of ore stacked on the pad in December. "Effective health protection measures are continuing and have safeguarded employees and local residents and enabled mine operations to continue, with no suspected or confirmed cases of Covid-19 at site,” comments Victoria CEO and president John McConnell. Victoria’s 100%-owned Dublin Gulch gold property is situated in the central Yukon Territory, Canada. In accordance with the company’s seasonal operations plan, ore stacking on the leach pad has now been curtailed for the 90 coldest days of the year, January through March. During this 90-day period, mining operations, primary crushing and stockpiling of ore will continue, as will leaching and gold production. Subject to favourable weather conditions, ore stacking may resume ahead of schedule. The shutdown of the secondary crushing and stacking systems provides an “excellent opportunity” to finalise the optimisation programme that began in the fall, the company notes. A number of specialty contractors have been mobilised to site to complete this work.
