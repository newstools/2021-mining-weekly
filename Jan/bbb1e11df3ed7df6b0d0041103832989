Aim-listed BlueRock Diamonds has sold a 14.8 ct diamond for $167 000. The 14.8 ct diamond was recovered on December 21, 2020, around the same time as the recovery of an 8.7 ct diamond, which was sold for $37 000. BlueRock executive chairperson Mike Houston says these diamonds were sold through tender, the first the company has participated in since the advent of the Covid-19 pandemic. “The general results of the tender were very positive and support the recent industry news suggesting that diamond prices are recovering well.”
 
The 14.8 ct diamond is the third large diamond recovered by the company in the fourth quarter of 2020 with an individual value of greater than $50 000, which Houston is hopeful “marks a return to normality” now that the company has developed the main pit at its Kareevlei mine, in South Africa’s Kimberley region.
