Canadian junior exploration company GoldHaven Resources, which is active in the Maricunga gold belt of northern Chile, has appointed Jack Pritting to the company’s advisory board for its Chilean operations. GoldHaven CEO Daniel Schieber says Pritting’s experience is “invaluable” to GoldHaven, particularly given his involvement in the exploration of Kinross’s La Coipa mine. “Jack was instrumental at La Coipa and led Kinross’s exploration activities in the Andean region from Colombia to southern Argentina.” The Maricunga measures 150 km north-south and 30 km east-west and is host to discoveries in the last ten years of 100-million ounces of gold, 450-million ounces of silver and 1.3-billion pounds of copper. GoldHaven has agreements in place to acquire seven high-priority exploration targets, as identified by geological studies. To date, the company has identified four of these seven properties as being high-priority targets and will commence a drilling programme during the first quarter of the year.
