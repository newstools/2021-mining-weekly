The hearing into Aim-listed phosphate explorer and developer Kropz’s Elandsfontein project’s integrated water-use licence (WUL) has been rescheduled for February 1. Kropz notes that the Water Tribunal will be resumed in February following a number of postponements since March 2020 owing to Covid-19 concerns. As such, Kropz advises the market that, to allow the tribunal the appropriate opportunity to fully review the matter, it will not be providing further comment on the official proceedings until the tribunal has announced its decision. However, Kropz also notes that the timing of the decision is currently unknown. Pending the tribunal's decision, Kropz reports that there is no legal impediment to the continuation of the water-use activities authorised in the WUL.
