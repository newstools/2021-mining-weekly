TSX-V-listed Nouveau Monde Graphite expects to obtain governmental authorisation for its Matawinie graphite project, in Québec, early in the first quarter of this year, thereby enabling the construction of its commercial facilities. The company also expects to complete the construction and commissioning of its proprietary Phase 1 purification facility by midyear. The construction and commissioning of the Phase 1 purification facility will take place during the first half of the year in order to produce advanced material for lithium-ion batteries, while simultaneously securing the best long-term strategic partnerships and/or long-term supply agreements from the multiple ongoing discussions and qualification processes with battery makers and original-equipment manufacturers. Additionally, Nouveau will focus on the development of innovative emissions compensation projects in partnership with local communities, in order to demonstrate the company’s commitment to carbon-neutrality. Nouveau president and CEO Eric Desaulniers says the company intends to produce its first anode materials and further the execution of its business strategy, which is set to build a company which is one of the world’s largest high-quality anode material producers during 2021. “Our entire team understands the tasks at hand to deliver these thousands of tonnes of advanced material to our customers to enable the energy revolution for the good of the environment and the benefit of our economy.” The company expects the Matawinie project to reach commercial operation in 2023.
