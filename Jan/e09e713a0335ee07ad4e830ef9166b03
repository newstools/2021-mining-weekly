TSX-V-listed Hemlo Explorers has started drilling at its North Limb project, about 15 km north of the Hemlo mine in Ontario. The drill campaign is set to start with a minimum of 10 000 m in about 20 drill holes. This is the company’s first drill campaign since it consolidated the North Limb project with the O3 Mining property acquisition last year. Hemlo has invested significant efforts over the past eight months compiling data from previous drill holes, ground surveys and sampling. “We believe we have potential for a significant mineralized gold system similar to the Moose Lake Volcanic Complex at the prolific Hemlo gold deposit,” said Hemlo president and CEO Brian Howlett. Management has proposed drilling specific targets on the North Limb Property that will include testing numerous sections of the 8.2-km-long Armand Volcanic Complex trend, based on several anomalies outlined by drill intercepts, soil and rock assays, and geophysical signatures. The company believes that the Armand Complex resembles the geological setting of the Moose Lake Volcanic Complex at the Hemlo gold deposit that has produced over 21-million ounces since it began production in 1985 and is expected to be in operation until at least 2030.
