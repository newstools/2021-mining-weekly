PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Rare earths developer Pensana has submitted a planning application for its rare earth oxide separation facility in Yorkshire. The company told shareholders on Monday that the application could take up to three months to review. The $125-million facility is expected to employ some 100 direct staff during construction and operation, and would be one of the world’s largest producers of rare earth oxides. The project will be located at the Saltend Chemicals Park, which hosts a cluster of chemicals and renewable energy businesses, including BP Chemicals. The site provides ‘plug and play’ services with ready access to port, a wide range of utilities, power, chemical supply, logistics and a large pool of skilled personnel. “We have been delighted with the enthusiastic support from a broad range of stakeholders for this proposed investment, which will create high value manufacturing jobs in the Humber region and will be an important step in establishing the world's first sustainable mine-to-magnet metal supply chain in the UK,” said Pensana chairperson Paul Atherley. “The ‘plug and play’ services provided by the px Group at the world-class Saltend Chemicals Park have substantially reduced the capital cost of the proposed facility, allowing us to focus on the operational aspects of the investment and providing scope for our longer-term ambitions.” Pensana is in the midst of delisting from the ASX, and is expected to cease trading on the bourse on February 24.
