Amid a rise in Covid-19 infections, Lesotho has announced a 14-day nationwide lockdown. This has prompted ASX-listed Lucapa Diamond Company to suspend operations at its Mothae diamond mine. London-listed Gem Diamonds, however, says its Letšeng mine will remain fully operational. "The health and safety of all of our employees and contractors remains paramount to Gem and we shall continue with the testing and precautionary measures which have been effective at Letšeng and our other operations during this pandemic," Gem CEO Clifford Elphick says. Lucapa MD Stephen Wehterall assured the company's shareholders that the suspension was expected to be temporary in nature "as it is a mine operational health and safety decision, not a market limitation". Mining and processing operations would be restarted when the lockdown ends, he noted.
