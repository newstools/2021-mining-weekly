PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The Queensland state government is considering using isolated mining camps to quarantine travellers into the state, as part of measures to curb the transmission of the Covid-19 virus. The Queensland Resources Council (QRC) on Thursday said that it would continue to work with the Chief Health Officer (CHO), member companies and the state government to provide feedback on the Premier’s proposal, which will be discussed at National Cabinet next Friday. QRC CEO Ian Macfarlane said the QRC and its coal, metal and gas members have worked tirelessly and successfully to protect industry workers, their families and mining communities from Covid-19 over the past 11 months. “Our diligence has meant the resources sector has been able to continue to operate and earn for Queensland. This diligence and vigilance and the industry’s willingness to go above and beyond Queensland Health requirements was recognised by the CHO at a meeting earlier this week with the Premier and QRC,” Macfarlane said. “The resources industry will cooperate and assist where requested. Keeping our workers and the Queensland community safe, particularly in regional areas, will continue to be our priority. “We will work closely with the government to provide input into any decisions that impact on our workforce and the communities in which we operate.”
