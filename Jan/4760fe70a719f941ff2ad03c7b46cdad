Peruvian regulators have granted dual-listed Hudbay Minerals a final mining permit for the development and operation of the Pampacancha deposit, near the Constancia mine, following the conclusion of consultation between government and the community of Chilloroya. Restrictions imposed to fight the Covid-19 pandemic have delayed the conclusion of consultations with the Chilloroya community. “We are pleased that the government and the community were able to complete the Consulta Previa process despite challenges caused by the pandemic,” said Hudbay president and CEO Peter Kukielski on Monday. The company has started predevelopment activities, including haul road construction and site preparation work. Prestripping activities will start once all individual land-user agreements to provide full site access have been concluded.
