Diamond miner Lucara Diamond Corp has recovered an unbroken 341 ct top white gem-quality diamond from its Karowe mine, in Botswana. The diamond was recovered over the holiday period from milling of ore sourced from the south-western quadrant of the South Lobe M/PK(S) unit. The recovery of large gem-quality diamonds from the M/PK(S) unit of the South Lobe is in line with expectations and historical South Lobe recoveries. “Lucara is extremely pleased to be starting off 2021 with the recovery of a 341 ct high-quality white gem diamond that builds on previous historic recoveries which include the 549 ct Sethunya, a 998 ct diamond, the 1 758 ct Sewelô, the 1 109 ct Lesedi La Rona and the 342 ct Queen of the Kalahari. "The 341 ct diamond represents the fifty-fourth diamond greater than 200 ct to be recovered from Karowe since 2015. "The consistent recovery of these large diamonds is a testament to the continued strong resource and plant performance at Karowe and underpins our rationale for moving forward with the underground expansion programme that will see mining continue for at least another 13 years after the openpit ceases operations in 2026. We look forward to a productive and busy 2021,” says Lucara CEO Eira Thomas.
