JOHANNESBURG (miningweekly.com) – So far, only about 600 000 t to 700 000 t of South African coal have moved to China, an untraditional market. This all comes against the background of China to longer buying coal from Australia. Although more South African coal sales to China are expected “for sure”, the top trader who made this forecast sees the sales to China largely as an irrelevant rearranging of the deckchairs of the seaborne coal market, against the far bigger picture of the coal demand uptick being poised to considerably outstrip supply. So far the sales to China are still very small given that South Africa sells about 40-million tonnes of its roughly 70-million tonnes of coal exports into India every year, a market Australia will likely now target. The big beneficiaries of China’s ban on coal from Australia have been Indonesia, given that country’s proximity and sailing time, followed by Russia and then South Africa. Among the reasons why South Africa has not been a traditional supplier of coal to China are freight differentials, which have priced it out, as well as South African coal qualities being liked by sponge-iron producers in India and some of the cement plants and general industry in Pakistan and Malaysia.
