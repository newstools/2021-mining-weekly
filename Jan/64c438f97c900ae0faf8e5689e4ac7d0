Aim-listed explorer IronRidge Resources has defined multiple new pegmatite targets following auger drilling at the Ewoyaa lithium project, in Ghana, where the company has defined a Joint Ore Reserves Committee-compliant mineral resource estimate of 14.5-million tonnes at a grade of 1.31% lithium oxide in the inferred and indicated category. This includes 4.5-million tonnes at a grade of 1.39% lithium oxide in the indicated category, as announced by the company in January 2020. IronRidge CEO Len Kolff says an extensive auger drilling programme has been completed at the project, where Ghana’s first lithium resource of 14.5-million tonnes has been defined and which is within 110 km of the operating Takoradi deep-sea port. “Auger drilling has defined . . . new high-priority pegmatite targets, including outcropping spodumene pegmatite within the immediate Ewoyaa resource area.” The drilling reveals seven high-priority pegmatite target zones defined with individual pegmatites up to 460 m long and 30 m apparent width. The 12 896 m worth of mechanised auger drilling of 2 446 holes was completed on a 100 m by 10 m to 20 m grid. All the new targets occur within 500 m to 1.5 km of the current Ewoyaa resource footprint and within easy trucking distance for future mining, states IronRidge.
