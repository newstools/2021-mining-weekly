TSX-listed Lundin Gold managed to produce 242 400 oz of gold at the end of last year, since starting commercial production at the Fruta del Norte mine, in Ecuador, on March 1. By the fourth quarter, the project was milling about 337 000 t at an average throughput of 3 665 t/d. The average grade of ore milled during the quarter was 10.1 g/t and average recovery was 88.6%. “Fruta del Norte delivered another strong quarter to close out 2020. The grades mined, recoveries and average throughput were all better than expected during the fourth quarter. This enabled us to exceed the upper end of our gold production guidance of 170 000 oz for the second half of 2020,” says Lundin CEO Ron Hochstein. Lundin would publish more details on its year ended December 31, on February 24.
