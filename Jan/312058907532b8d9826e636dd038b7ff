Aim-listed IronRidge Resources has hit multiple high-grade intersections from drilling at the Zaranou project, in Côte d’Ivoire, confirming new gold targets. The licence area is along strike from significant operating gold mines Chirano, Bibiani and Ahafo in Ghana. Highlights of reverse circulation (RC) drilling over the Ehuasso, Coffee Bean, Mbasso and Yakassé deposits, include 16 m at 6.68 g/t gold from 100 m, 8 m at 14.01 g/t from 4 m and 8 m at 9.32 g/t from 32 m. High-grade and broad low-grade drill intersections reported at depth at Ehuasso and Yakassé confirm continuity of mineralisation at depth. CEO Vincent Mascolo comments that ongoing results from the current drilling programme have confirmed significant mineralisation potential along the 47 km strike Zaranou structure. “All newly-drilled targets across the south west of the licence area, including very encouraging preliminary results from Yakassé, show significant promise with high-grade drilling results returned and continuity observed between sections. “Our ‘early ounces’ strategy continues to target weathered oxide mineralisation, with initial observations suggesting it continues to average depths of 50 m and up to 90 m, which we believe is indicative of simple mining and processing at low operational and capital costs.” Mascolo adds that with only 12 km of the 47 km of identified strike having been drill-tested to date, an additional 8 km strike of hard-rock artisanal workings and 27 km of soil anomalies remain untested, with the potential to deliver a pipeline of further discoveries along this considerable mineralised structure. The company confirms that a 50 000 m RC and aircore drilling programme is ongoing at Zaranou and should be complete before the end of January.
