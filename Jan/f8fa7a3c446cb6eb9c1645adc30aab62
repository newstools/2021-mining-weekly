PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Gold and copper miner Aeris Resources has reported a 260% increase in the contained gold ounces at its Roses Pride deposit, at the Cracow gold mine, in Queensland. Following a surface drilling campaign in June of last year, the mineral resource estimate for Roses Pride is now estimated at 177 000 t, grading 4.6 g/t gold for 26 100 oz of contained gold. “The increased mineral resource at Roses Pride is a pleasing result and demonstrates the brownfield exploration opportunities that we believe exist at Cracow,” said Aeris executive chairperson Andre Labuschagne. Further drilling at the deposit is planned for the first half of 2021, with Aeris noting that the mineralisation remains open along strike.
