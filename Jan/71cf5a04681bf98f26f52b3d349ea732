London-listed Pembridge Resources' Minto mine in Canada's Yukon produced 24 646 wet tonnes of concentrate containing copper, gold and silver in 2020, up from 7 167 wet tonnes in 2019. Pembridge acquired the mine from Capstone Mining in June 2019 and started operations in October. Pembridge CEO and chairperson Gati Al-Jebouri says production started from the Copper Keel area in the fourth quarter of last year, as did development in the Copper Keel West area, although lower grades resulted in lower volumes of concentrate. The company produced 5 143 wet tonnes of concentrate in the fourth quarter, and 5 707 wet tonnes of concentrate in the third quarter. Al-Jebouri expects a further increase on yearly production in 2021.
