PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ ASX-listed junior Marquee Resources has launched a review of its Clayton Valley lithium project, in Nevada, following renewed interest in both the lithium sector and in North American lithium projects. The Clayton Valley project covers some 12 km2 of claims holding both lithium-rich brines and clays, located on the north-east side of the southern end of the Clayton Valley basin, and neighbouring the only producing lithium mine in North America. The company told shareholders on Friday that drilling results from 2017 had opened the south-eastern Clayton Valley to an expanded potential, which could potentially rewrite the geology of the area. Following recent informal inquiries regarding the project, Marquee is now exploring the possibility of a farm-in or joint venture partnership, or an outright sale.
