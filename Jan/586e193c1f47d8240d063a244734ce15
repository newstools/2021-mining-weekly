PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Diamond miner Lucapa has raised A$7.2-million in revenue from its first diamond sales of 2021 from its Mothae mine, in Lesotho. The miner on Monday reported that a parcel of 4 676 ct of rough diamonds was sold for a total of $5.6-million, or $1 198 per carat, marking the highest average US dollar per carat price achieved by Mothae on the sale of any run-of-mine production parcel. The sale included a number of Specials, including the 101 ct D colour diamond recovered in the fourth quarter of last year, which was the most valuable recovered at the Mothae mine to date. “Following a tough 2020, where both our mines were impacted by the pandemic, our valued teams have shown their resilience and operations have bounced back strongly,” said MD Stephen Wetherall. “The good recoveries at both mines and growing demand leading to strengthening diamond prices have seen a strong start to 2021.”
