Harmony Gold says it is on track to meeting its full-year production guidance of between 1.26-million and 1.3-million ounces of gold after having produced 745 347 oz in the six months ended December 31, 2020. The higher gold production was as a result of the integration of the Mponeng and Mine Waste Solutions (MWS) assets, as well as the effective measures adopted in preventing and mitigating the impact of Covid-19 and disciplined mining. Since assuming full ownership of Mponeng mine, MWS and related assets, these have contributed 103 525 oz. CEO Peter Steenkamp says that through navigating the return-to-work challenges, top of mind was the health, safety and overall wellbeing of Harmony’s employees. “I wish to commend our health and operational teams for the remarkable job done in ensuring a safe return to work.” He adds that the integration of Mponeng and MWS went according to plan and contributed both to the quality of the ounces produced and overall production.
