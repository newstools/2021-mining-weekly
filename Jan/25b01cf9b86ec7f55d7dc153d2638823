The Crown Estate has announced the outcome of its Minerals Licensing Round, granting Cornish Lithium rights to explore for lithium within geothermal waters in areas off both the north and south coasts of Cornwall, England. The Crown Estate manages the seabed and much of the foreshore around England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It says in a statement that the UK currently imports lithium and theÂ environmentally-responsible production of lithium in the UK could be a vital step forward in combating climate change, since lithium is used in lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles and renewable energy power storage. The UK is committed to achieving zero carbon emissions by 2050. The rights award to Cornish Lithium follows a comprehensive two-year tender process and environmental assessment known as a plan-level Habitats Regulations Assessment that concluded in December. Cornish Lithium can now explore offshore for potential lithium mineral resources contained within geothermal waters. The company will begin its desk-based exploration programme and identify potential geological targets for later research. Cornish Lithium will not be physically exploring the waters for at least four years, following the appropriate desk studies, design works and extensive consultation.
