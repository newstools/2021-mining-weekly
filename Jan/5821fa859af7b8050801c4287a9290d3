ASX-listed Lepidico has announced that it is in confidential discussions with up to six lithium hydroxide consumers and three caesium/rubidium consumers. The company says it has been advised by one prospective customer that its analysis of a lithium hydroxide monohydrate sample provided in 2020 should be completed by early this year, allowing offtake discussions to advance. It is understood that the analysis process has been disrupted by the ongoing pandemic. Further lithium hydroxide samples are being prepared for dispatch over the coming weeks from the company’s existing inventory in Perth for analysis by other consumers. Lepidico says it continues to closely monitor the caesium and rubidium markets globally with significant supply constraints envisaged to occur this year, as pollucite stockpiles sourced from now depleted mines are consumed. Lithium mica ores now represent the only material near-term source of the strategic metals caesium and rubidium, both of which are designated as critical minerals by the US State Department and for which the US is entirely reliant on imports. Lepidico has a global footprint in lithium through its own projects, as well as joint ventures and alliances in Australia, Canada and Portugal.
