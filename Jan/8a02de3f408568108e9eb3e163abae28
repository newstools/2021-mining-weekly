The US Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has issued a record of decision (RoD) for the Thacker Pass lithium project, in Nevada, project developer Lithium Americas announced on Friday. The company plans to extract lithium from a clay deposit in two phases, over about 40 years, producing about 60 000 t/y of battery-grade lithium carbonate. The federal approval comes as the US is pushing for increased domestic mining of specialised minerals. Lithium is a key component of electric vehicles. “The issuance of the RoD is the culmination of over 10 years of hard work from the Thacker Pass team, as well as the BLM and other federal, state and local agencies, all of whom worked tirelessly to ensure their respective commitments to environmental stewardship and community engagement,” commented Lithium Americas president and CEO Jon Evans. “With the federal permitting process complete, our focus is on advancing the financing process including discussions with potential strategic partners.” Initial capital costs are estimated at $581-million for Phase 1, which will produce 30 000 t/y, and $478-million to double output in Phase 2. The project, north-west of Winnemucca, also still requires some key state approvals. The company has submitted applications for state permits and water rights transfers.
