PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Gold production at the Karouni mine, in Guyana has stabilised during the three months to December, ASX-listed Troy Resources reported on Thursday. Gold production in the three months to December reached 4 195 oz, compared with the 6 334 oz produced in the September quarter, and the 7 235 oz produced in the June quarter. Troy told shareholders on Thursday that production for the quarter was below initial expectations, due to a number of factors, including continuing uncertainty related to the Covid-19 pandemic, apparent difficulties in the reconciliation between mine and mill production, as well as apparent process reporting and production issues. The miner said that a considerable amount of investigation and effort has been undertaken and has identified a number of issues that have since been remedied, encompassing ore modelling, plant procedures and personnel matters. Troy noted that production levels were now returning to normal, with actual production reconciling well with forecast, with the company expected to revise its production guidance shortly.
