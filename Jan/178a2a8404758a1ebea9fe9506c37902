Diversified miner BHP and automotive manufacturer Toyota Australia have partnered on a new light electric vehicle (LEV) trial at BHP’s Nickel West operations in Western Australia. Under the partnership, a Land Cruiser 70 has been converted from running on diesel to being fully electric through onboard battery power. It is expected to fulfil several roles at site and operate in aboveground and underground settings. BHP Minerals Australia president Edgar Basto says this partnership is another step in BHP’s ongoing studies into how it can reduce the emissions intensity of its light vehicle fleet. “It builds on other LEV trials underway in South Australia and Queensland. Reducing our reliance on diesel at our operations will help achieve our medium-term target of reducing operational emissions by 30% by 2030.” Toyota Australia president and CEO Matthew Callachor says the trial is another step Toyota is taking as part of its bigger picture of a zero emissions future. “BHP and Toyota have demonstrated a strong relationship throughout the last 20 years and this project is a great testament to how we can both work together as leading companies in our respective industries to change the future.” BHP Nickel West asset president Eddy Haegel says BHP expects to also see a reduction in fuel and maintenance costs, in addition to a reduction in noise, heat and diesel particulate matter. He adds that the battery in the Toyota LEV Landcruiser also contains a high proportion of nickel. “With Nickel West being both a battery raw material producer and consumer in the electric vehicle market, it is a terrific opportunity to support Toyota with their understanding and development of electric vehicles for the mining industry, whilst also reducing the carbon footprint from our own nickel operations.” This Toyota trial builds on BHP’s trials with other suppliers that are under way at Olympic Dam in South Australia and Broadmeadow in Queensland.
