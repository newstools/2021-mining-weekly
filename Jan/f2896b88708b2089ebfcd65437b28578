PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Argosy Minerals has been accepted as a member of the European Raw Materials Alliance (ERMA) as a primary raw materials partner. Furthermore, the company has also been accepted as a member of the European Battery Alliance (EBA) 250 Network, which also includes the European Commission, EU member States, the European Investment Bank, and more than 400 industrial, innovation and academia stakeholders. “The ERMA and EBA are two organisations committed to building diverse supply chains with which we hope to work within. Europe has become a key pillar to the growth of the electric vehicle (EV) market, having recently exceeded EV sales compared with China,” said Argosy MD Jerko Zuvela, noting that the company remained focused on discussions with European offtakers. Argosy is currently focused on developing its flagship Rincon lithium project, in Argentina, and also owns the Tonopah lithium project, in Nevada. The company’s Stage 1 industrial scale pilot plant at Rincon is now operational, and work is progressing on the Stage 2 development which will produce some 2 000 t/y of lithium carbonate production. “Argosy aims to commence construction of the 2 000 t/y high purity battery grade lithium carbonate processing plant shortly and will target, amongst other markets, offtakers in the EU. We believe the company’s exclusive, proprietary and successful environmentally clean and conventional chemical process technology, specially developed for our Rincon lithium project, will suitably fit within the Alliance requirements,” said Zuvela.
