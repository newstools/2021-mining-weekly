Precious metals miner Sibanye-Stillwater CEO Neal Froneman says it is with deep sadness that the company announces the “tragic passing” of its South African gold operations executive VP Shadwick Bessit, who succumbed to Covid-19-related complications on January 16. “The board and management have extended their sincere condolences to Bessit’s family, friends and all his colleagues. We mourn the loss of a dear colleague, a leader and highly valued member of the senior leadership team.” Froneman notes that Bessit was an invaluable member of Sibanye-Stillwater’s leadership team. “He will be missed. May he rest in peace.” Bessit leaves behind his wife Rachelle, three children; Michelle, Shantelle and Lesley-Ann and two grandchildren. Bessit joined Sibanye-Stillwater on its establishment in February 2013, after having joined Gold Fields in July 2012. Bessit was appointed as South Africa gold operations executive VP in February 2019. He also held the positions of Kroondal and Rustenburg operations senior VP, and Kloof and Driefontein underground operations senior VP. Sibanye has appointed South Africa gold operations technical services senior VP William Osae as interim domestic gold operations head to ensure operational continuity and the ongoing focus on safe production. The Minerals Council South Africa also conveys its condolences to Bessit’s family, friends and colleagues, saying he was a passionate and dedicated member of the council board and the CEO Zero Harm Forum. “He will be sorely missed.” Having spent three decades working in the mining industry, Bessit was deeply committed to the South African mining industry and showed great concern and empathy for those working within the industry and living in the surrounding communities, the Minerals Council states. “He was a dedicated and compassionate leader and played a material role in the Minerals Council and in the mining industry. It is a tragedy that his life was cut short.”
