 Resources company Asia Broadband, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Asia Metals, has finalised negotiations with joint venture partner Qiangda Investments & Economics for the buyout mineral property and mining operations  in the Guerrero Gold Belt (GGB), in Mexico. Asia Metals is a resource company focused on the production, supply and sale of precious and base metals, primarily to Asian markets. The principal terms of the purchase terms have been accepted and agreed to by both parties, while the secondary terms and transition processes are being specified and scheduled. The full details of the purchase agreement will be released mid-January. Asia Broadband CEO James Gilbert says the company’s management team is “thrilled and grateful” to reach a milestone achievement with the sale of its GGB property and operations. “We are also very excited for the new opportunity to move forward rapidly from a much higher level of operations.” Asia Metals uses its specific geographic expertise, experience and extensive industry contacts to facilitate its innovative distribution process from the production and supply of precious and base metals in Guerrero, Mexico, to its client sales networks in Asia.
