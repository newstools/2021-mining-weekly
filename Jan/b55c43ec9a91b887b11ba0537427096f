Aim-listed Kavango Resources has appointed David Smith nonexecutive chairperson and Ben Turney executive director, with immediate effect. Smith is a solicitor who has worked in corporate finance and the equity capital markets for over 30 years. Since January 2016, he has been a partner in Druces, the company's solicitors. He will lead the board at Kavango with particular focus on internal controls and corporate governance. Turney has been working as a consultant for Kavango since April. The company says he has played a key role in reshaping its investor relations and the successful completion of the recent £2-million placement. Turney is responsible for the company’s public relations. CEO Michael Foster welcomed both men to the board, noting that their contribution to Kavango would be “invaluable” as the company moves forward with its exploration projects in Botswana. Kavango’s focus in Botswana is centred on three projects, which are prospective for copper, nickel and platinum group element metals.
