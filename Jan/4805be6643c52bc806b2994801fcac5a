Aim-listed Rainbow Rare Earths has appointed Chris le Roux as lead process consultant and Charles Graham as lead project manager. Le Roux is a process engineer, with significant experience and an in-depth knowledge of numerous technical processing operations, the company noted. Graham has more than 20 years of multidisciplinary mining and infrastructure project management experience across Africa, and a diploma in mechanical engineering. The two will work closely with Rainbow technical director Dave Dodd. "We are delighted to welcome Chris and Charles to the team, which, led by our technical director Dave Dodd, will help drive Rainbow's long-term growth into a globally significant rare earths producer. With their combined wealth of experience, they will be instrumental in the delivery of our new Phalaborwa project, in South Africa, as well as the ongoing development of Gakara, in Burundi,” said CEO George Bennet. Rainbow’s two projects are the high-grade Gakara project, in Burundi, and the Phalaborwa project, in South Africa. Gakara is Africa’s only rare earth mine and is currently producing a high-grade concentrate from trial mining and processing, which is exported to China.
