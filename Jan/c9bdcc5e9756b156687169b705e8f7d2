State-owned power utility Eskom will be implementing Stage 2 load-shedding between 22:00 and 05:00 on January 6 and 7. The load-shedding is necessary to recover and preserve the emergency generation reserves that have been used to support the system during the week following the earlier-than-planned shutdown of Koeberg power station’s Unit 1 and other units whose return to service has been delayed, the utility notes. There is currently 6 672 MW of capacity on planned maintenance, while another 12 073 MW of capacity is unavailable owing to unplanned maintenance. Eskom teams are working around the clock to return as many of these units to service as soon as possible.
