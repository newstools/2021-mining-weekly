PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Diamond miner Lucapa has restarted mining operations at its Mothae mine, in Lesotho. The company earlier this month suspended mining operations as a result of a 14-day nationwide lockdown initiated by the government of Lesotho to curb the spread of Covid-19. “It is great to see the Mothae mine operating once again as we prioritise the health and safety of our teams returning to site. With the diamond market continuing its strong momentum into 2021, we look forward to the remainder of the quarter and completing the expansion project on time,said MD Stephen Wetherall on Friday. The expansion plan for Mothae would increase the project’s capacity from 1.1-million tonnes a year to 1.6-million tonnes a year, at a capital cost of $6-million.
