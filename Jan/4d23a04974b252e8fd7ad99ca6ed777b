Diamond miner Lucara Diamond has recovered an unbroken Type IIa 378 ct gem-quality top white diamond from milling of ore sourced from the M/PK(S) unit of the South Lobe at its 100%-owned Karowe mine, in Botswana. This recovery is the second gem-quality diamond of greater than 300 ct to be recovered this year from direct milling of the M/PK(S) unit. Lucara says the find is a further testament to the strong resource and process circuit performance at Karowe. The 378 ct and the 341 ct diamonds were recovered from the coarse X-ray transmission circuit. Lucara CEO Eira Thomas says the “superb” 378 ct diamond found marks a strong early start to this year. “The 378 ct joins a rare and special lineage of exceptional, high-value diamonds recovered at Karowe and continues to highlight the wonderful diamond potential of Botswana.” Continued and consistent recovery of large diamonds, such as the 378 ct and 341 ct diamonds, she says, come at a critical time and provide continued strength and additional foundation to the opportunity to finance and build the underground expansion at Karowe that will see mining continue for at least another 13 years after the openpit ceases operations in 2026. “We look forward to a safe, productive and busy 2021.”
