PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The hydrogen division of ASX-listed Real Energy Corporation, Pure Hydrogen Corporation, has inked a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Australian division of US-based HYZONE Motors, to collaborate on the development of a network of hydrogen refueling points in Australia. The two companies would also focus on developing a wet hire solution, to supply HOZON’s vehicles to local customers. “This MoU with such an established and respected hydrogen fuel cell vehicle company like HYZON is an outstanding development and excellent validation of our plans to develop a hydrogen focused energy business in Australia,” said Real Energy MD Scott Brown. “We have a number of other initiatives under way which will clearly reflect the value we are building in the Pure Hydrogen business. We believe we can build significant value in our Pure Hydrogen business for our shareholders, and look forward to working with HYZON.” The MoU establishes a framework under which HYZONE and Pure Hydrogen would collaborate to provide hydrogen solutions to end-users, which is likely to be fleet customers. This could include referring potential customers and collaboratively working to develop a network of hydrogen refueling points. HYZON Motors Australia director John Feenan said that Australia was a key market for the integration of hydrogen power technology into hard-to-abate sectors, such as heavy transportation. “This MoU with Pure Hydrogen paves the way for both parties to boost the hydrogen infrastructure capabilities of Australia and propel the nation’s fleet operators towards a zero-emissions future,” he said.
