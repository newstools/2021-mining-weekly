PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Lake Resources has launched a definitive feasibility study (DFS) for its Kachi lithium brine project, in Argentina. A 2020 prefeasibility study (PFS) estimated that the project could have an annual production of 25 500 t/y of battery grade lithium carbonate over a mine life of some 25 years, with the project likely to require a startup capital investment of $544-million. The PFS estimated a post-tax net present value of $748-million and an internal rate of return of 22%, with annual sales over the life of the project targeted at over $7-billion. “The formal commencement of the DFS is a key step for Lake to deliver the Kachi project into production with environmental, social and corporate governance credentials in demand as the transition to electric vehicles gathers pace,” said Lake Resources MD Steve Promnitz. “The bridging studies have been underway since the PFS and now the formal engagement of Hatch has occurred,” he added. The associated workstreams that will run in parallel with the DFS include the environmental impact study, continued community engagement, and a demonstration plant which will be commissioned on site later in 2021. The DFS is due for completion by the first quarter of 2022.
