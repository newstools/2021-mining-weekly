TSX-listed precious metals explorer Goliath Resources reports extensive expansion of its claim holdings by 28%, based on significant results that cover additional key geologic terrane around the Surebet high-grade polymetallic gold/silver discovery on its 100%-controlled Golddigger property in the Golden Triangle of British Columbia. The company has also adopted a shareholder rights plan, the purpose of which is to provide protection for the shareholders and board of directors with adequate time to consider and evaluate any unsolicited bid and to provide the board with adequate time to identify, develop and negotiate value-enhancing alternatives, if considered appropriate, to any such unsolicited bid. The Golddigger property has been expanded by 28%, from 18 587 ha to 23 858.51 ha based on significant results that cover additional key geologic terrane around the Surebet zone. Golddigger is located on tide water 30 km south east of the Stewart municipality in the Golden Triangle, and only 7 km west of the Dolly Varden mine access road, thereby providing for cost effective exploration. Goliath CEO Roger Rosmus states that the Surebet discovery and results to date have “far exceeded” the company’s expectations and have “excellent potential” to rapidly evolve into a higher-grade gold/silver mineralised system in the Golden Triangle. The newly discovered Surebet zone is located about 8 km south west of Fury Gold Mines’ Homestake Ridge property, a high-grade gold/silver resource estimate that contains 982 700 oz of gold at a grade of 4.99 g/t and 19.6-million ounces of silver at a grade of 97.7 g/t. Multiple high-grade polymetallic gold/silver targets have been identified along 1 km of strike at surface and 500 m of vertical relief. “The interest from majors and institutional investors alike is a strong testament of the mineralisation to date on the project in a low political risk and geopolitically stable jurisdiction of British Columbia, Canada,” he says. In addition, Rosmus notes that Goliath looks forward to carrying out its fully funded 2021 inaugural drill programme.
