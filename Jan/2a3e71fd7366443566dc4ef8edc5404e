PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Diamond miner Lucapa has recovered its 18th diamond of more than 100 ct at its Lulo alluvial mine, in Angola. The miner on Monday reported that a 104 ct D-colour white stone had been recovered at Mining Block 46, the second stone of more than 100 ct to be recovered at this site since the start of the year. The company earlier this month announced the recovery of a 113 ct D-colour white stone from Mining Block 46, indicating the potential for the block as Lucapa moved deeper into the southern terraces.
