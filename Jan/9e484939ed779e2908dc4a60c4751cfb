Exploration and development company Bluejay Mining is reorganising its board as it progresses to the next stage of development, particularly at its Dundas ilmenite project, in Greenland, following a successful end to 2020. The board reorganisation, effective from January 4, will see CEO Rod McIllree make the move to executive chairperson of the board, with former chairperson Mike Hutchinson becoming nonexecutive director and chair of the remuneration committee. Former COO Dr Bo Møller Stensgaard will take up the position of CEO. Additionally, nonexecutive director Ian Henderson has retired from the board, while the company’s titanium market expert Peter Waugh remains a nonexecutive director. McIllree welcomed Stensgaard's appointment as CEO, adding that he is “well placed to drive the development of the rest of Bluejay’s portfolio together with the rest of [the company’s] very skilled and experienced management team”.
