PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Mineral Commodities has secured two additional graphite prospects near its existing Skaland graphite mining operations, in Norway. The company on Tuesday reported that it had entered into a landowner agreement to explore the Hesten and Vardfjellet graphite prospects, which are some 4 km west of the Bukken exploration prospect, for which Mineral Commodities subsidiary Skaland was granted exploration rights in mid-2020. The two tenements are also located some 15 km south-east of the existing Skaland graphite mining operation, which is the highest grade flake graphite operation in the world, and the largest producing graphite mine in Europe. “With the addition of Hesten and Vardfjellet to our existing Bukken exploration project, we have secured some of the most prospective ground proximal to Skaland,” said Mineral Commodities CEO Mark Caruso. “By securing these prospects, Mineral Commodities has the opportunity to further expand our strategy to build our resource inventory at Senja. This investment in exploration highlights Mineral Commodities’ commitment to graphite production at Skaland and contributes to our overall expansion goals.” The company intends to start exploration work in the June quarter of this year, comprising further ground-based geological mapping and sampling to determine higher grade locations to target drilling.
