Impala Rustenburg, a member of the Impala Platinum (Implats) group, on April 9 handed over nine completed social and labour plan (SLP) projects to communities near its operations. The projects represent over R94-million of investment from Impala Rustenburg, several years of work and the creation of 714 jobs through construction and development. The projects include three road upgrades, 15 offices, a multipurpose centre, a community hall, a community centre, a sports facility and a water scheme upgrade. Speaking on site at the handover of the multipurpose centre in the Kanana Village, Impala Rustenburg CEO Mark Monroe highlighted that the projects are aligned to the company’s commitment to make a difference in the communities in which it operates. The projects form part of Impala’s first and second generation SLP undertaking. Monroe said the work was not done merely to comply to SLPs, but to showcase that big companies can contribute to communities, with Impala aiming to be a “good neighbour and citizen” to communities. The facilities were designed with input from the communities and aim to engage citizens. Monroe expressed hope that the facilities created would improve the lives of the Rustenburg communities, and that the multipurpose centre would create opportunities especially for young people; and that the facilities would be maintained well by the communities over the years. He said the company would also provide learnerships and programmes, in addition to the infrastructure it has provided. Moreover, Monroe said the company would continue to provide more support and other infrastructure to communities in the years to come.
