PERTH (miningweekly.com) – First concentrate production from the Plomosas zinc mine, in Mexico, is targeted for later this week. ASX-listed Consolidated Zinc on Wednesday told shareholders that mill commissioning at Plomosas has now started, and wet commissioning of the plant is expected over the next 48 hours. “The Plomosas operation and project teams have produced excellent work in a difficult environment impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, and a severe winter storm across Texas and northern Mexico closing the US and Mexico roads and ground traffic for days at a time,” said Consolidated Zinc MD Brad Marwood. While first concentrate from the Plomosas plant was expected later this week, the Aldama plant continues to produce concentrates from the Plomosas mine. The company started zinc production at Plomosas in September 2018 and achieved commercial production in December 2018. The miner is now ramping up production through the third party-owned Aldama concentrator and has an offtake agreement to sell all zinc concentrate produced to the Met-Mex Smelter located in Torreon, Mexico, a part of the Penoles Group. Consolidated Zinc previously said that the Plomosas plant refurbishment would cost some $1.35-million, and would allow for the expansion of the plant from 3 000 t/m to 6 000 t/m.
