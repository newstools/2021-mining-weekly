An employee at gold miner Gold Fields’ South Deep mine, in South Africa, lost his life in a mining incident on April 13. Vumile Mgcine, a shaft timberman, succumbed from injuries sustained while attempting to unblock a shute outlet on an underground conveyor belt, the company reports. The Department of Mineral Resources and Energy (DMRE) has been advised of the incident and an in loco inspection, led by the DMRE and supported by trade union representatives and mine management, will take place on April 14. South Deep’s human resources team is providing assistance to the deceased employee’s family, who will also be supported in accordance with a range of the mine’s policies. "As I start my work at Gold Fields, there is no more tragic reminder of the overriding importance of safety at our mines than the death of a colleague. My heartfelt condolences go out to Vumile’s family, friends and colleagues. Management will do everything possible to support them in this hour of need,” says CEO Chris Griffith.
