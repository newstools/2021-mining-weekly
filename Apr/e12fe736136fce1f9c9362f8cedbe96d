PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Junior explorer Viking Mines will raise A$4-million in a share placement to sophisticated and professional investors to fund drilling at its First Hit gold project, in Western Australia. The company said on Friday that it had received firm commitments for the placement of more than 111.11-million shares, at a price of 3.6c each, in an oversubscribed placement.
