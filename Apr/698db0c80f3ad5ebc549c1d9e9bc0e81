PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Iron-ore major Fortescue has contracted Perth-based Pacific Energy’s subsidiary Contract Power Australia to build Western Australia’s largest network integrated battery energy storage system (BESS). Contract Power will design, construct, test, install and commission two BESS units as part of Fortescue’s integrated power network in Western Australia’s Pilbara region. The BESS units will be integrated with a transmission network being built by Fortescue to distribute electricity from new gas and solar power facilities to Fortescue’s Pilbara mine sites. This is the second major contract awarded to Contract Power by Fortescue as part of their Pilbara Energy Connect programme and follows the award in July 2020 of a major contract to construct the gas-fuelled power station component of the project.
