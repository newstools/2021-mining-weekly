Australia-based mine and civil contracting company RUC Cementation Mining Contractors (RUC) has been awarded a contract worth about R2.3-billion for the shaft lining and equipping contract at Newmont Corporation’s Tanami Expansion 2 project in Australia’s Northern Territory. RUC is a division of South Africa-based engineering company Murray & Roberts (M&R), and is a diversified underground mining contractor with an extensive portfolio of completed and current projects throughout Australia and the Asia-Pacific. M&R state that capital investment in the mining sector continues mainly in brownfield expansions, although it is expected that investment in new mines will return from mid-2021 onwards. M&R’s mining platform holds a significant position in most major regional underground mining markets in the western world and is well positioned to benefit from the expected improvement in market conditions, the company states. Having wholly owned the Tanami mine since 2002, the expansion project is aimed at deepening and expanding the Callie underground mine at Dead Bullock Soak to access ore at depth and increase production to 3.2-million tonnes a year.
