Mining company Nornickel has announced an expansion of production from its nickel refinery in Finland in response to growing demand for responsibly produced electric vehicle (EV) battery materials in Europe. In Phase 1, nickel output at the Harjavalta refinery will increase from 65 000 t/y to 75 000 t/y in 2023 and in Phase 2, to more than 100 000 t/y by 2026. "This expansion will further strengthen Harjavalta refinery's position as one of the most sustainable producers of nickel and cobalt metals to the EV battery industry,” said Nornickel Harjavalta MD Joni Hautojärvi. Harjavalta produces nickel in cathodes, briquettes, crystallised salts and solution, and cobalt in crystallised sulphate and in solution. The production process is based on sulphuric acid leaching of nickel semi-products, a modern, high-tech approach that enables more than 98% extraction rate. “Our unique product portfolio combined with EV battery metals recycling development enables NN Harjavalta to be the leading European supplier of the critical metals to the growing battery sector in Europe,” added Hautojärvi. Harjavalta is mainly powered by renewable energy and its expansion is in line with Nornickel’s strategy of ensuring a global shift to a greener economy, while being green itself.
