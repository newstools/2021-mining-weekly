The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) in the Carletonville region is appealing for government intervention around the Blyvoor gold mine, as labour and social unrest escalate. The union explains in a statement issued on April 7 that tension has been building up between workers and Blyvoor Gold’s management over workers’ right to freedom of association. According to the NUM, workers are being intimidated and threatened with violence if they refuse to join the so-called Blyvoor Workers Union, which is the company’s union of choice. The union further states that about 60 workers have been dismissed so far for launching a strike, protesting against the company’s attitude towards NUM members. The union states that the right to freedom of association is essentially an “enabling” right that entitles workers to form and join workers' organisations of their own choice to promote common organisational interests. The NUM says it is issuing a warning to the Blyvoor mine management to desist from entering into union politics. "They must refrain from interfering with, restraining or coercing employees in the exercise of rights relating to organising, forming or joining a trade union of choice."
