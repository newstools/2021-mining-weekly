Canadian development company Hudson Resources is confident that it is “business as usual” for its projects in Greenland, following the Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA) party’s recent election victory. Hudson president Jim Cambon says the IA party has publicly stated that it is pro-mining and that it has cited the company as a good example of the importance of mining in Greenland. IA has taken an anti-radioactive-element stance, which has cast doubt over the Kvanjefield rare earth project, which Australian project developer Greenland Minerals is developing. Cambon says that although Hudson’s projects do contain minor amounts of thorium or uranium, the company will not export and sell these elements and they will be dealt with in an environmentally responsible manner. Hudson owns 100% of the Sarfartoq rare-earth-element project and Nukittooq niobium-tantalum project and also holds a 31.1% interest in Hudson Greenland, which owns the White Mountain anorthosite mine.
