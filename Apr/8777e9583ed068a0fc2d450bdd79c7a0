TSX-V-listed GoviEx Uranium has signed drilling contracts with Esafor and Foraco to undertake drilling programmes related to a feasibility study for its Madaouela uranium project, in Niger.

GoviEx CEO Daniel Major says that following the positive results of the updated prefeasibility study (PFS) that was announced on February 18, and based on the company’s view that the uranium market fundamentals are demonstrating continued improvement, GoviEx has decided to move straight on to the completion of the feasibility study required to secure project financing. “A key benefit from the updated PFS was the simplification and optimisation of the project, which has also simplified the scope of the remaining test work expected to be completed in support of a feasibility study.” As a result, GoviEx’s priorities for the advancement of Madaouela include a drilling programme designed to further the understanding of the molybdenum mineralisation of the project and confirmatory metallurgical test work. GoviEx has planned a 13 000 m drilling programme, with a combination of rotary mud and diamond core drilling, to an average depth of 100 m. This drilling programme, located at the Miriam deposit, will focus on three main objectives, the first being drilling a 50 m grid within the planned openpit shape to confirm an indicated mineral resource for molybdenum mineralisation. The second objective is the final corroboration of the geotechnical slope design for Miriam, which was steepened from 51° to 53° in the updated PFS. The third objective is the verification of whether Miriam dewatering is sufficient to support process water requirements rather than developing a standalone well field as is currently assumed given the reduced water use defined in the updated PFS. Positive results, if they are achieved, will potentially permit reduced operating and capital costs associated with water supply, and could also lower the potential environmental impact.
