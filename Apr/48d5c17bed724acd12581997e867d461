Aim-listed Zanaga Iron Ore Company’s (Zioc’s) recosting exercise on a 12-million-ton-a-year staged development iron-ore project in Congo-Brazzaville is being completed and is expected to be concluded around the middle of April. As announced in September, Jumelles, the joint venture company between Zioc and Glencore, initiated the cost review process to ascertain the potential costs associated with the construction of the Stage 1 project in the current contractor pricing market. External engineering firms were engaged by Jumelles to complete this evaluation.
