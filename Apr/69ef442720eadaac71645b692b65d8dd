TSX- and NYSE-listed platinum group metals miner Platinum Group Metals (PTM) has received a further notice appealing the granting of a mining right to Waterberg Joint Venture (JV) Resources. The mining right had been granted by the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy (DMRE) on January 28. The notice of appeal is reported to have been filed by a local community in the area of the proposed mine infrastructure. However, PTM says in a statement that it believes all requirements specified under the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act (MPRDA) have been complied with and that Minister Gwede Mantashe's office correctly granted the mining right. As such, Waterberg JV Resources will oppose the appeal. Under the MPRDA, an appeal can be considered by Mantashe for determination within a 130 business day timeframe. The mining right currently remains active and was notarially executed by the DMRE on April 13. PTM says it has completed “well-documented, extensive and meaningful consultations” with “recognised” representatives in local communities, the DMRE and government. It points out that consultations had also previously been held with the group that lodged the appeal. The Waterberg project is projected to be a large palladium, platinum, rhodium and gold mine, which PTM anticipates will result in “significant positive spin-offs” in terms of investments, exports, jobs and skills development. Going forward, PTM intends to continue its consultation with the DMRE and recognised local authorities and community representatives regarding its plans for the Waterberg site.
