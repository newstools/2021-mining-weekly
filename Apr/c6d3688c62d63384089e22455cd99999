Exploration company Arctic Star has announced a new discovery on the Diagras joint venture project, which is next to the Diavik and Ekati diamond mines, in Northwest Territory. Named the Birch kimberlite, it was discovered by targeting an electromagnetic and gravity anomaly. Birch was discovered after drilling 28 m through 11 m of water and 17 m of overburden (glacial till). The drill exited the kimberlite at 71 m. Artic Star says a second hole from the same drill set-up is under way to obtain more kimberlite for caustic fusion. The drill collar is 220 m southeast of the known Black Spruce kimberlite discovered in the 1990s. After completing the current drill, Arctic will move from the Birch discovery to test other similar targets. “The priority is to make as many discoveries as we can before the ice melts,” says exploration VP Buddy Doyle. The Diagras project is a JV with Margaret Lake Diamonds.
