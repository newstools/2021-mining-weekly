PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Uranium miner Energy Resources of Australia (Era) has reported a more than 90% fall in production for the March quarter, compared with both the previous and the previous corresponding quarters, as processing operations at its Ranger mine, in the Northern Territory, ceased in January. Uranium production during the March quarter reached 34 t, down 92% on the previous corresponding period, and down 91% on the previous quarter, as production from the Ranger mine ceased in accordance with the Ranger Authority after 40 years of operation. Era in February announced that it would progress the remediation of the Ranger 3 Deeps decline and would decommission the Ranger ore processing facilities through the remainder of the first half of the year. Plant decommissioning is expected to be completed in the third quarter of this year. While the timing of plant demolition works remains under review, the current plan supports demolition activities to start in 2023. Era told shareholders on Wednesday that the company expected to complete sales into its existing contracts through 2021, of some 1.37-million pounds, with the balance of the inventory holdings to be sold progressively into the spot market. Meanwhile, the progressive rehabilitation of the Ranger project area continued during the quarter.
