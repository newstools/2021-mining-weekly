TSX-V-listed Los Andres Copper has received unanimous approval from the regional environmental committee for drilling to be carried out at the company’s Vizcachitas project, in Chile. The approval allows the company to drill up to 350 holes on up to 124 platforms over the next four years, if required. The regional environmental committee unanimously approved the drilling permit application submitted by Compañia Minera Vizcachitas Holding, the wholly owned subsidiary of Los Andes that owns the Vizcachitas project.
 
Los Andes Copper will now carry out the drilling to complete a prefeasibility study (PFS). The proposed work plan includes infill drilling within the PFS openpit, drilling to extend the higher-grade mineralisation to the north of the preliminary economic assessment pit and to test the prospective geophysical targets identified in 2020.
