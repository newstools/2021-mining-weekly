Canadian explorer Skeena Resources, which is revitalising the past-producing Eskay Creek gold/silver mine in the Tahltan Territory in the Golden Triangle, is returning its mineral tenures for the Spectrum mineral claim to establish a new conservancy. The new 3 500 ha conservancy adjoins the 230 000 ha Mount Edziza Provincial Park and will protect the environment and wildlife of the Tahltan territory. The Tahltan central government, British Columbia Province, Skeena, the Nature Conservancy of Canada, and BC Parks Foundation have worked in partnership to create the conservancy. "Mount Edziza and the surrounding area have always been sacred to the Tahltan nation. The obsidian from this portion of our territory provided us with weaponry, tools and trading goods that ensured our Tahltan people could thrive for thousands of years,” says Tahltan central government president Chad Norman Day. “I am so relieved and thrilled that Mount Edziza is better protected for our future generations." The conservancy is the first step in the multi-year Tahltan Stewardship Initiative (TSI). The goal of the TSI is to bring greater self-determination to the Tahltan nation and support stewardship on Tahltan territory. Tahltan government plans to rename the area within the conservancy at a future date, to better reflect Tahltan heritage.
