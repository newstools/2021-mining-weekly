PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Uranium hopeful Lotus Resources has started share trading on the Over the Counter (OTC) market in the US under the symbol LTSRF. The company on Thursday told shareholders that its secondary listing on the OTC was aimed at enhancing the visibility and accessibility of the company to North American investors, with the listing allowing potential North American investors to both trade and settle during US trading hours and in US dollars. The OTC trading is non-dilutive to existing shareholders, as no new shares were being issued to enable trading on the OTC. The ASX-listed company recently increased its ownership in the Kayelekera uranium project, in Malawi, to 85% after exercising its rights over an additional 20% interest in the project.
