US-based uranium mining and exploration company Uranium Energy Corp (UEC) has completed an initial 40 development holes at the first production area (PAA-1) of its Burke Hollow in-situ recovery (ISR) project in south Texas. VP for resource development Andy Kurrus says the drilling results to date have been pleasing and that it continues to improve the company’s understanding of the five Goliad Formation roll fronts or trends within PAA-1. The results demonstrate potential for further resource growth within PAA-1, with several drill intercepts returning 2.45 to 4.48 grade thickness. This is above the 0.3 grade thickness cut-off for ISR estimation and wellfield development. “The development of Burke Hollow, the only recent uranium discovery in the United States, continues to exhibit the potential to be the largest Goliad Formation deposit ever discovered in the South Texas Uranium Trend,” Kurrus points out. Drilling will continue with additional resource delineation test holes, followed by installation of about 45 additional exterior monitoring wells to accommodate the trend extensions, complementing the 76 monitor wells previously installed. Kurrus says UEC has a strong pipeline for additional production areas at Burke Hollow, including defined resources outside of PAA-1 and several exploration targets and anomalous areas that have only been lightly explored.
