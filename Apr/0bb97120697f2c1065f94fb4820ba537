Canada-based gold mining company Centerra Gold on Monday announced that it would list its common shares on the NYSE, with trading expected to start on Thursday. The Toronto-headquartered miner’s primary exchange would remain the TSX. “We are listing on the NYSE at a time when our company is expecting strong earnings, robust free cash flow generation and growing gold production in the coming years. Given the progress being achieved, we believe it is the correct time to list on the NYSE to increase our visibility and exposure to investors in the United States,” said president and CEO Scott Perry. Centerra operates the Kumtor mine in Kyrgyzstan, the Mount Milligan mine in British Columbia, Canada and the Öksüt mine in Turkey.
