Nevada-focused i-80 is gearing up for a major drill campaign at its Getchell project, near Winnemucca, CEO Ewan Downie said on Thursday, announcing that it had completed the purchase of the project from Waterton Global Resource Management. The Getchell project will be i-80’s focus for the year, with the 22 000 m drill campaign designed to upgrade and expand mineralisation in the underground and openpit horizons. Downie said the aim of the drill campaign was to advance the development of the high-grade Pinson underground mine within the next 12 months, while at the same time progressing permitting of the openpit, heap leach, mining opportunity. A preliminary economic assessment for the project will be released during the current quarter. i-80, which also listed on the TSX this year, also owns the producing South Arturo mine.
