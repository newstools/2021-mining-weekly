PERTH (miningweekly.com) – First ore has been successfully processed through the Butcherbird plant, in Western Australia, ASX-listed Element 25 reported on Thursday. The company told shareholders that commissioning activities at the manganese mine site were progressing well, with the project team now fully focused on normal commissioning activities. Element25 noted that in-specification 30% to 35% manganese concentrate had been successfully produced early in the commissioning process, and early indications were encouraging with respect to potential plant throughput. The company noted that a number of optimisation opportunities would be explored and minor engineering modifications were being implemented during the normal commissioning process to enhance plant availability, processing throughput and product quality. “This is another important milestone in the development of the project and we look forward to updating the market further in coming weeks as we progress towards our first shipment,” said Element25 MD Justin Brown. The Butcherbird operation is expected to produce 341 000 t/y of manganese concentrate, at a grade of 33% manganese, over a mine life of 40 years.
