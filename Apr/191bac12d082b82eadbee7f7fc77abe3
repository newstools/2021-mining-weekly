Diversified miner Anglo American has delivered on its commitment to source 100% renewable energy for all its operations in Brazil, Chile and Peru. The miner previously secured renewable energy to meet all of its power requirements for its iron-ore and nickel operations in Brazil from 2022, as well as for its copper operations in Chile from this year. It has now entered into an agreement with Engie Energía Perú to provide 100% renewable energy for the Quellaveco copper operation, in Peru, from 2022. “Copper has such an important role to play in enabling the global transition to a low-carbon economy, so it is important for Anglo’s new world-class copper mine in Peru – Quellaveco – to lead the way by minimising its own carbon and broader environmental footprint. “The combination of renewable energy and our FutureSmart Mining programme’s higher precision technologies, which target the required metals and minerals more precisely, with reduced water, energy and capital intensity, is changing the very nature of mining and how our stakeholders experience our business – for the better,” says Anglo American Peru CEO Tom McCulley. “Our sourcing of only renewable energy to power our operations across South America marks another step towards our 2030 greenhouse-gas reduction target of 30% that is embedded in our Sustainable Mining Plan and towards our commitment to be carbon neutral across our global operational footprint by 2040,” adds Anglo American corporate relations and sustainable impact group director Anik Michaud.
