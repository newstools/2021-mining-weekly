Aim-listed Katoro Gold will be advancing its Haneti nickel and platinum group metals (PGMs) project, in Tanzania, to deep diamond drilling following the receipt of results from the recently completed maiden rotary air blast (RAB) drill programme, which targeted the discovery of nickel and PGMs. Katoro holds a 65% ownership interest in Haneti with 35% held by Aim-listed Power Metal Resources. Katoro chairperson Louis Coetzee says that information from the recent shallow drilling results and the discovery of new gossanous nickel/copper/magnetite veining at Mihanza Hill confirmed the results from previous exploration work done at Haneti, which was the primary objective of the RAB drill programme. “The latest results provided the confirmation we wanted to take the next step in our exploration strategy for Haneti and to proceed with deep diamond drilling. With the diamond drill programme, we will assess the potential for possible economic nickel sulphide mineralisation at Haneti,” he notes. Planning and design of an appropriate diamond drilling programme, as well as the selection and engagement of a suitable drilling contractor, is currently taking place.
