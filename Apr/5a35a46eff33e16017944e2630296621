PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The board of ASX-listed Aurelia Metals has greenlit the start of a feasibility study for the Federation base and precious metals project, in New South Wales, following a positive scoping study. The scoping study confirmed that the Federation deposit was amenable to underground mining, and could produce saleable lead, zinc and copper concentrates, along with gold. The scoping study also considered both the modification of the process plant at the Hera mine, some 10 km away, and the construction of a new process plant at the Hera site to recover gold in dore and to produce separate copper, lead and zinc concentrates. The opportunity to treat some of the Federation material through the process plant at Aurelia’s Peak mine was also identified. “Federation represents one of the most significant discoveries in the Cobar basin in recent decades. Deposit scale continues to grow and the tenor of the mineralisation is outstanding. Completion of the scoping study has confirmed the sheer quality of this project development,” said Aurelia MD and CEO Dan Clifford. “It has also provided us with the confidence to immediately progress to a feasibility study and submit approvals for an exploration decline development.” The feasibility study is scheduled for completion by mid-2022.
