JSE-listed Eastern Platinum (Eastplats) has appointed Wylie Hui as CFO and corporate secretary. Hui is a certified public accountant, chartered accountant and brings over 25 years of finance and operational experience to his role with Eastplats, particularly his experience in mining. He has previously served as the CFO of several publicly listed mining companies. Hui succeeds Rowland Wallenius, who has resigned to pursue other opportunities. Eastplats will continue to engage Wallenius as a consultant in the short term, as may be needed from time to time to assist in the transition. PGM OPERATIONS IN SA Meanwhile, Eastplats recently completed the reconfiguring and optimisation of the small-scale platinum group metals (PGMs) circuit, the PGM Circuit D, which also included completion of the initial work required to restart the main PGMs plant circuit. Following the completion of the work, Eastplats generated about 111 t of PGM concentrates, and has delivered about 64 dry tonnes under the existing offtake agreement with Impala Refining Services. Eastplats completed the upgrades to obtain higher-quality concentrate to be able to consistently produce a minimum of 200 t of PGMs concentrate monthly, having a positive impact on the company’s revenue. The PGM Circuit D uses the initial work on the PGM Main Circuit. The next phase of the PGM Main Circuit work continues to be scheduled to start in May, with commissioning expected in October. Eastplats estimates this will add a further 800 t of PGMs concentrate monthly to production, thereby increasing production four-fold and continuing to grow Eastplats’ revenue.
