Diversified miner Exxaro Resources has appointed Geoffrey Qhena as an independent nonexecutive director and chairperson designate, with effect from April 19. Qhena, a chartered accountant, is presently a nonexecutive independent board member of Investec Bank and the chairperson of the South African Airways interim board. During his career, Qhena served as CFO and CEO of the Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa (IDC). He also gained extensive board leadership on the IDC investee boards, including as a nonexecutive director of Spanish listed stainless steel company Acerinox. With the IDC being a significant shareholder of Exxaro over a number of years, Qhena brings with him a clear understanding of the company and the sector in which it operates, Exxaro says.
