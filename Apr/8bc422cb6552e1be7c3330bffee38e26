Ferrochrome producer Merafe Resources reports that its attributable ferrochrome production from the Glencore Merafe Chrome Venture increased by 3% year-on-year to 130 000 t for the first quarter of this year. The increase, which has been achieved despite the Lydenburg smelter and Rustenburg Furnace 5 being on care and maintenance, is as a result of production efficiencies realised at Merafe’s smelters.
