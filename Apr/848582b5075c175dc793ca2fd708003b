PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Junior Tombador Iron is on track to start production at its namesake project in Brazil by the second quarter of this year, pending the award of regulatory approvals. The ASX-listed company on Monday announced that it had secured iron-ore export facilities, inking an agreement with the operator of the Aracaju Port, VLI Multimodal SA. Under the terms of the agreement, Tombador would cart its high-grade iron-ore by truck to the Aracuja port, where VLI would provide stockpile storage capacity, materials handling and ship loading services, sufficient for loading an initial 35 000 t, with the option to expand the port storage capacity. Furthermore, the company has also executed a service agreement with Polimodallog Logistica E Transportes to provide truck haulage services, carting the lump iron-ore and fines product some 700 km from the Tombador mine to the Aracaju port.
