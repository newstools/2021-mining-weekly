PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Pure Hydrogen has inked a joint venture (JV) agreement with Synergen Met to manufacture hydrogen and carbon products. Using Synergen’s design and built methane decomposition modules, the JV would manufacture ‘turquoise’ hydrogen gas and value add carbon products from Pure Hydrogen’s 11-trillion cubic feet of methane resources and other gas resources. Pure Hydrogen on Tuesday said that the term sheet contemplated two stages, with the first involving a prototype of a shipping container sized module capable of producing around 1 400 kg of hydrogen and 4 200 kg of value-add carbon product running 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Stage 2 would piggy-back on the first stage, which would focus on the development of the carbon product, if feasible, which would include synthetic graphite, graphene flakes or carbon nanotubes, potentially adding substantial value to Pure Hydrogen’s methane resources in Queensland and Botswana. “This is a very promising commercial development for Pure Hydrogen and Synergen as we are combining proven technology with a methane resource to produce hydrogen and solid carbon products, which potentially adds another valuable revenue stream to Pure Hydrogen’s business and an exciting technology angle to Pure’s strategy,” said Pure Hydrogen MD Scott Brown. Power for the JV will be sourced from a combination of grid-, solar- and site-generated electricity. If grid and solar electricity is used, with the grid electricity generated from renewable sources, the entire methane-to-hydrogen and value add carbon manufacturing process would result in no greenhouse gas emissions.
