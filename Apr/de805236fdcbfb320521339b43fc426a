TSX-listed Osisko Mining on Thursday released new results from the ongoing drill programme at its Windfall project, in Quebec. The new results include 78 intercepts in 46 drill holes and 12 wedges. The company says the infill intercepts are located inside defined February 2021 mineral resource estimate (MRE) blocks, while the expansion intercepts are located outside the MRE. “Once again the drilling in the Lynx area delivers both inside and outside of the February 2021 MRE blocks. Further, expansion drilling in the Triple Lynx corridor continues to provide strong targets for growth as demonstrated by Hole OSK-W-20-2371-W1, one of our top results today. As we noted in our April 7, 2021 preliminary economic assessment update, ongoing drilling is showing great potential to see further increases in the already strong economic base case of the Windfall deposit,” said Osisko CEO John Burzynski. Selected high-grade intercepts include: 369 g/t over 3.5 m in OSK-W-21-2369-W3; 155 g/t over 3.0 m and 45.7 g/t over 2.1 m in WST-21-0670; 129 g/t over 3.2 m in OSK-W-20-2252-W11, 144 g/t over 2.5 m in WST-21-0657; 123 g/t over 2.4 m in OSK-W-20-2371-W1, 78.4 g/t over 3.1 m in OSK-W-21-2480, 70.0 g/t over 2.6 m in WST-20-0568, 76.4 g/t over 2.2 m in WST-20-0578, and 52.6 g/t over 2.3 m in OSK-W-20-2420.
