TSX-listed Ivanhoe Mines has appointed Ben Munanga to succeed Louis Watum as chairperson. Kamoa Copper is the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) operating company of the joint venture between Ivanhoe Mines, Zijin Mining Group, Crystal River and the government of the DRC. The partners are developing the Kamoa-Kakula copper mine. Watum has been appointed GM of Ivanhoe’s Kipushi zinc/copper/silver project, also in the DRC. Munanga has been the GM of Ivanhoe Mines Energy DRC – a sister company of Kamoa Copper responsible for delivering reliable, clean, renewable hydropower to the Kamoa-Kakula mine – since August 2015. Prior to serving in this role, Munanga was the head of power, infrastructure and bulk services at Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation, as well as serving in various roles at South African State-owned power utility Eskom. Additionally, Ivanhoe has also appointed its DRC public affairs VP Oliver Binyingo to the board of directors of Kamoa Copper to further enhance the subsidiary’s collaboration with government partners and communities. “We are thrilled to have Munanga and Binyingo join Kamoa Copper’s board of directors as we pursue our goal of building an enduring, responsible, multinational mining company. “Both are passionate advocates of the DRC mining industry, and we believe they will provide valuable perspectives as Kamoa Copper continues its journey to becoming the world’s greenest, major copper producer,” Ivanhoe co-chairperson Robert Friedland says.
