Development of the Bermejal underground mine – one of three planned expansion projects at the Los Filos mine, in Mexico, is under way. Bermejal is a higher grade expansion project that will increase Los Filos’ yearly production, reports Equinox Gold CEO Christian Milau. In addition, Los Filos has signed an updated social collaboration agreement with the Carrizalillo community, which is similar to the previous social collaboration agreement with a term to April 2025 and certain clarified provisions that will facilitate improved implementation. Community blockades have periodically hampered production at Los Filos. Milau says the agreement with Carrizalillo will provide meaningful health, social and economic benefits to the community, while ensuring fair and reasonable distribution of benefits for local communities and stakeholders.
