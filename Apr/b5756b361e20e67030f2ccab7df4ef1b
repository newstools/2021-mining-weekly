Canadian uranium company Denison Mines on Wednesday announced the discovery of new high-grade unconformity-hosted uranium mineralisation from the winter 2021 exploration programme completed at the McClean Lake joint venture (JV), which is operated by 77.5% owner Orano Canada. Three of the final four drill holes completed by Orano returned uranium mineralisation at the McClean South target area, with results in drill hole MCS-34 returning 5.04% U3O8-equivalent over 14 m. “The mineralised intersection in MCS-34 represents one of the better mineralised intersections reported on the McClean Lake property to date – which is impressive, as the property has been explored since the mid-1970s and has previously produced over 50-million pounds U3O8,” commented Denison exploration director Andy Yackulic. Not only has the drilling intersected high-grade uranium, but the mineralisation is open along strike to the west for at least 250 m and about 70 m to the east at the McClean South 8E pod. The 2021 exploration programme consisted of 15 drill holes totalling 4 083 m. It was designed to test for the potential expansion of previously discovered mineralisation in the McClean South 8W and 8E pods, as well as to test for new mineralisation in the surrounding area. Any meaningful new discovery on the McClean Lake property, in Saskatchewan, has the potential to translate into an important source of future feed for the McClean Lake mill, which has excess capacity.
