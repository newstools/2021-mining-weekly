The China Huaneng Group Clean Energy Research Institute and diversified miner Glencore have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to cooperate on carbon capture use and storage (CCUS) technology, starting with Glencore’s Carbon Capture Transport and Storage Company (CTSCo) project at the Millmerran power station in Australia. The MoU was signed on April 10 at the sixth China International Conference on Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage Both companies have committed to supporting the deployment of low emissions technologies like CCUS to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions from the use of fossil fuels and other industrial processes. The CTSCo Project in Queensland will use China Huaneng’s carbon capture technology at the Millmerran coal-fired power station to capture a stream of carbon dioxide, which will then be transported and stored permanently in a nonpotable aquifer at a depth of more than 2 km. “This is the first integrated international carbon dioxide capture and storage project that China has participated in. Huaneng will work with Glencore to complete a high-quality carbon capture project in Australia's Surat Basin, build a high-quality cross-industry international cooperation project, help coal-fired power generation achieve near zero emissions and enhance its international influence,” says China Huaneng Group Clean Energy Research Institute chairperson Dr Li Weidong. Glencore CEO Ivan Glasenberg has welcomed the ongoing collaboration with China Huaneng. “We are very pleased to strengthen our collaboration with China Huaneng on the CTSCo project. This project is vitally important because it can scale up to support the reduction of Scope 3 emissions from the use of fossil fuels across a range of industrial sectors,” he said. The CTSCo project is considered to be Australia’s most advanced onshore CCUS project and is expected to demonstrate CCUS at an industrial scale.
