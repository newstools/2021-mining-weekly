PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Emerald Resources is on track to start commissioning of its Okvau gold project, in Cambodia, by the second quarter of this year, with first gold pour also planned for the second quarter. “Our dedicated team in country has advanced the development of the Okvau gold project significantly in recent months to be on schedule for the successful commissioning of the process plant and deliver first gold production prior to the end of the current quarter,” said MD Morgan Hart on Friday. “This represents an exceptional effort given the logistical challenges brought on by the global pandemic and done while maintaining first-class protocols to ensure the continued health and wellbeing of staff, contractors and stakeholders.” The $98-million, two-million-tonne-a-year Okvau operation will deliver about 106 000 oz/y of gold over an initial mine life of seven years. “The expected first gold production will mark a significant milestone for Emerald and herald a new chapter for the company as a 100 000 oz/y gold producer with an average life-of-mine all-in sustaining cost of $754/oz,” said Hart.
