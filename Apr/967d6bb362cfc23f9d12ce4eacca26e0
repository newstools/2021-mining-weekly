PERTH (miningweekly.com) – Potash developer Salt Lake Potash has received environmental approval to scale up its projects to 245 000 t/y of sulphate of potash (SoP). The ASX-listed company on Thursday said that the environmental approval enabled the company to finalise the construction of pond trains four to six, as well as associated trench and bore construction that would support full-scale operation at its Lake Way project, in Western Australia. “Receiving final environmental approval over the full Lake Way project will enable our team to commence construction of the remaining on-lake infrastructure and deliver the full scope of the Lake Way project,” said CEO Tony Swiericzuk. Construction work on the final components of on-lake infrastructure is expected to start this quarter. Lake Way is expected to produce 245 000 t/y of SoP over a mine life of 20 years, based on the high grade probable ore reserve of 5.4-million tonnes SoP.
