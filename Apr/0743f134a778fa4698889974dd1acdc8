Diversified natural resources company Eurasian Resources Group (ERG) has established a dedicated environmental, social and governance (ESG) committee with the aim of fully incorporating sustainability practices into the group’s strategy and decision-making processes. The new committee serves as a testament to ERG’s commitment to long-term sustainability and to realising the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the company said in a statement on April 28. The committee will serve as the principal decision-making body in relation to the group's ESG policies, ensure accountability and provide an in-depth analysis of ERG’s ESG projects. It will also be tasked with ESG goal setting and reporting and the development of ESG-related competencies within the group. As part of its ESG strategy, ERG aims to increase its use of renewable energy sources and build on its global efforts to accelerate the responsible sourcing of materials for the energy transition. The report is also part of its commitment made as a member of the UN Global Compact. Chaired by Eurasian Group supervisory board chairperson Aldiyar Kaztayev, the committee includes representatives of the group’s senior management across its geographies. ERG transformation and sustainability head Anastasia Kuskova acts as deputy chairperson of the committee.
