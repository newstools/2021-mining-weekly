With a claimed remaining life-of-mine of more than 30 years, the chrome mineâ€™s auction will comprise the sale of movable property including fully-developed underground infrastructure, wash plant and integrated foundry circuit. The auction will also accompany the sale of the mining rights for the LG6 chrome seam, with a claimed 43% of chromium oxide in situ. Bidders Choice states that the mine has additional underground and opencast potential. Applications to take part in the bidding must be submitted to Bidders Choice by April 19.
