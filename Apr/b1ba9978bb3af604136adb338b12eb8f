Chilean lithium producer SQM said on Tuesday that it will auction the remainder of 22.4 million of the companyÂ´s series B shares on the Santiago stock exchange issued to help underwrite an ambitious expansion of its lithium, nitrate and iodine operations. SQM said it will on April 28 offer a total of 754,383 common stocks not purchased during a 30-day preferred option period at $50 per share. "The shares may not be offered to third parties in securities or conditions more favorable than those of the preferential offer," the firm told the local securities regulator.
