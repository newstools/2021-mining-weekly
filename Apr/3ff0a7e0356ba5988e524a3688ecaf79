Dual-listed diamond explorer Botswana Diamonds will begin a further drilling programme on its Thorny River diamond prospect, in South Africaâ€™s Limpopo province, on April 19. Following the discovery of the River kimberlite pipe, the company upgraded the potential of the property. An area with a similar geological and geophysical footprint immediately to the east of the River Pipe has been identified. Analysis suggests potential for a larger kimberlite body than already identified. Following completion of earth works during the course of this week, a six-hole reverse circulation programme will be undertaken. The programme is expected to take two weeks to complete, with the results to be announced shortly thereafter.
