PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed coal developer Montem Resources has welcomed the Alberta government’s decision to start an independent public consultation on a new coal development policy. The government’s plans to develop a coal policy follow its decision to rescind the 1976 coal policy in June of last year, and to reinstate it in February this year on the back of public concerns. The reinstated Coal Development Policy dictates the condition for coal leasing, exploration and development, and prohibits future coal exploration approvals on particular land types. “We support the process the government is undertaking to devise an updated coal policy for Alberta. We look forward to participating in the consultation process and providing our input on responsible steelmaking coal project development in Alberta,” said Montem MD and CEO Peter Doyle. Montem’s Tent Mountain mine, which has been categorized by the Alberta government as an advanced stage project, and its Chinook coal project are both wholly within Category 4 lands, which allow for opencut mining. “Montem’s key assets are in Category 4 land that has always been contemplated for surface mining. We are seeking to restart operations at the Tent Mountain mine and to continue exploration at Chinook in the area surrounding the historic Vicary mine,” said Doyle. “These are strong assets on previously disturbed lands with the potential for long life, low cost, hard coking coal production. The fact these assets are in Category 4 land allows us to continue our work unhindered by the reinstatement of the 1976 Coal Policy.”
