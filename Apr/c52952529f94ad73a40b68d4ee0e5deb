Aim-listed explorer IronRidge Resources has commenced with 2 500 m of reverse circulation (RC) drilling at the Kineta North gold licence in north-eastern Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa. With expected completion in the second quarter of the year, the drilling is designed to test the Kineta North target where previously reported soils defined a 2 km-long by 250-m-wide gold soil anomaly of greater than 30 parts per billion. There was also coincident underground artisanal workings over a 700 m strike and previously reported rock-chip sampling results including 15 g/t, 32.4 g/t and 46.4 g/t of gold. The new drilling campaign will also test previously reported trenching intersections where multiple gold intersections were reported, including 2 m at a grade of 4.04 g/t gold and 6 m at a grade of 0.24 g/t gold. To date, visible gold has been observed in quartz vein RC drill chips in the first hole completed, with assays pending. IronRidge CEO Vincent Mascolo says the Kineta portfolio covers a contiguous combined surface area of 1 532 km2 within the north-east of Côte d'Ivoire and along the same shear structure that hosts the 3.3-million-ounce Konkera resource and 2.1-million Wa-Lawra resource.
