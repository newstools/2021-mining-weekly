PERTH (miningweekly.com) – The first lead and zinc concentrates have been produced at the Plomosas zinc mine, in Mexico. ASX-listed Consolidated Zinc on Friday reported that construction of the tailings dam had been completed, with the project now operational, while process plant refurbishments were also completed within budget. The refurbishment has been designed to initially operate at 100 t/d, but there is capacity to upgrade the process to 200 t/d by the end of the year. “The establishment of our own processing facility has been a long time coming. I believe this is the final step to the Plomosas mine producing high quality concentrates, consistently and cost effectively,” said Consolidated Zinc MD Brad Marwood. “With commissioning of the wholly-owned processing plant, we now have full control over both the mining and processing functions for the first time. I am very pleased with the outstanding efforts of all personnel who worked to make this opportunity a reality. “During the next six months we will focus on maximizing returns in what appears to be a stronger cycle for zinc and lead while metal demands are seeing concentrate treatment charges return to historically average levels, some 47% less than the prior year.”
