A series of hydrometallurgical process testing to produce battery-grade niobium at the James Bay project, south of Moosonee, Ontario, has begun, reports TSX-V-listed NioBay Metals. CEO Claude Dufresne says new niobium battery technology could change perceptions of electric vehicles (EVs), noting that niobium-based materials enable fast charging times (1 to 10 minutes), increased battery safety, long cycle life and improved EV performance. “The development of niobium battery technology is creating a great opportunity and we are well positioned to participate in its development,” he says, noting that the test programme could also be expanded to NioBay’s Crevier niobium and tantalum project, in Quebec. Chairperson Serge Savard adds that current EV technology is unable to compete with the performance, reliability and refueling times associated with internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, but that niobium-based technologies could change that. “Niobium-based batteries will charge cleaner, safer, and faster than ICE vehicles,” he says. The results of the first series of tests, to be performed by SGS Canada in Lakefield, are expected in four to six months. A 2020 preliminary economic assessment for the James Bay project has yielded robust economics. Should the company opt for an openpit scenario - one of three contemplated in the study - the project will produce 5 470 t/y over 30 years. The James Bay property was once owned by Barrick Gold, James Bay Columbium and Goldcorp.
