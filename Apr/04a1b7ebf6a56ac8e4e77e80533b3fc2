Ontario gold miner Pure Gold Mining has increased the size of its previously announced C$10-million bought-deal offering, on the back of strong demand. Pursuant to the upsized deal terms, Clarus Securities, as lead underwriter for a syndicate of underwriters, has agreed to 9 868 400 flow-through shares for gross proceeds of about C$15-million. The flow-through shares will be priced at $1.52 each. The underwriters have an over-allotment option to purchase an additional 1 480 300 shares, which, should it be exercised in full, will increase the gross proceeds of the offering to C$17.25-million.
