TSX-V-listed Deep-South Resources’ common shares have been approved for, and admitted to, trading on the OTCQB Venture Market. “Trading on OTCQB marks an important milestone for the company and enables us to expand our audience and shareholder base in the American market as we continue to advance the development of our Haib copper project, in Namibia,” says Deep-South president and CEO Pierre Leveille. The OTCQB Venture Market is for entrepreneurial and development stage US and international companies. To be eligible, Canadian companies must be current in their home market reporting and undergo a yearly verification and management certification process. Deep-South will also apply shortly to the Depository Trust Company (DTC) for DTC eligibility, which it says will greatly simplify the process of trading its common shares. DTC manages electronic clearing and settlement of publicly traded companies across the US and in 131 other countries.
