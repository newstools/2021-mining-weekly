Private equity investor Pallinghurst Group has announced the retirement of chairperson and co-founder Brian Gilbertson. Gilbertson, Arne Frandsen and Andrew Willis founded the battery materials investment company in 2006. Frandsen mentions fondly that Gilbertson had been one of his first clients as an investment banker for Goldman Sachs, about 27 years ago. He adds that Gilbertson’s lifetime of leadership at Rustenburg Platinum, Gencor, Billiton, BHP Billiton, Rusal, Vedanta and Pallinghurst has cemented his position as one of the greats of the mining industry. Meanwhile, the company has also announced its establishment of an advisory panel, with six industry professions based across Europe, North America, Australia and Africa. The panel comprises Dr Rod Baxter, Dr Lumkile Mondi, Julien Naginski, Betty Joy LeBlanc, George Nakos and Garth Higgo. Baxter has also been appointed chairperson of Pallinghurst Australia, as the company expands its focus to investments in the Australian battery materials market. The panel members have various fields of expertise, including in natural resources, merger and acquisition activity, macroeconomics, legal matters, investor relations and engineering.
