PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed Mineral Commodities (MRC) has struck a non-binding memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Superior Graphite to fast-track anode production into the European battery market. Under the terms of the MoU, the two companies would work together to form a joint venture (JV) that would use Superior Graphite’s proprietary electro-thermal purification technology to purify MRC’s natural flake graphite at an existing thermal purification facility in Sweden. It is hoped that the JV could produce between 15 000 t/y and 20 000 t/y of sustainable graphite anode material to battery manufacturers in Europe, the UK and Australia. MRC said on Tuesday that, based on Superior’s preliminary assessment, existing thermal purification capacity could be complemented by auxiliary technology to provide an efficient, sustainable in-situ coated anode material for lithium-ion batteries. “We are privileged to have the opportunity to partner with Superior. The JV would provide MRC with a faster route to vertical integration for greater margin capture, reduced technology risk and capex while maintaining our commitment to produce the most sustainable graphite anode material possible,” said MRC chairperson David Baker. MRC will now start a period of due diligence on Superior’s facility, the acquisition structure and the opportunity more generally.
