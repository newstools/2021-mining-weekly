PERTH (miningweekly.com) – ASX-listed minerals explorer Province Resources and France-based independent power producer (IPP) Total Eren have inked a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to potentially develop a green hydrogen project in the Gascoyne region of Western Australia. The proposed project would be developed in two stages, and would total up to 8 GW of installed renewable energy capacity, which would be jointly owned by Province and Total Eren. Under the terms of the MoU, the partners would complete a scoping study on the proposed hydrogen project and are targeting the execution of definitive agreements within the next four months. “Given the recent drive by state and federal governments to quickly develop and advance the green hydrogen industry in Australia, I am confident this project will be of strategic national importance,” said Province MD David Frances. “Province is excited to have a global renewable energy leader such as Total Eren as a partner with the technical and financial capability to help Province deliver this project as part of the backbone of the nation’s hydrogen strategy,” he added.
