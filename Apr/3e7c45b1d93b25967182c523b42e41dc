Exploration junior Musk Metals has entered into an agreement to acquire a 100% interest in the Pakeagama lithium claims, located in the so-called electric avenue pegmatite field of north-western Ontario. The acquisition comes hot on the heels of Musk Metals’ acquisition late last month of the Elon project, in Quebec. "Musk’s second lithium project acquisition is situated next to one of North America's highest-grade, large tonnage hard-rock lithium resources in Ontario’s electric avenue,” says CEO Nader Vatanchi. Covering about 1 490 ha, the Pakeagama property is contiguous to Frontier Lithium’s claim group and about 3 km south of the Pak and Spark lithium deposits. Musk Metals states that the Pak deposit contains one of North America's highest-grade, large tonnage hard-rock lithium resources in the form of a rare low-iron spodumene. The PAK deposit has a mineral reserve in the proven and probable categories of 5.77-million tonnes, averaging 2.06% Li2O. The Spark deposit has a mineral resource estimate of 3.2-million tonnes, averaging 1.59% Li2O (indicated) and 12.2-million tonnes averaging 1.36% Li2O (inferred).
