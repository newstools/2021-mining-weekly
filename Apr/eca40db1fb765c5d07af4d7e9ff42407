Aim-listed Bushveld Minerals on April 19 said industrial action at its Vametco operation, in the North West province, has resulted in a temporary halt in production from April 16. It is understood the unprotected industrial action is in relation to expectations of payments under the Employee Participation Plan (EPP) at Vametco; however, the company said it had yet to receive a formal notice from organised labour. Senior management has held a series of meetings with representatives of the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) – the recognised trade union at the vanadium mining operation – during which it was agreed that all reasonable steps would be taken to urge employees to safely return to work. Bushveld and AMCU recently concluded the EPP, which is designed to provide a framework whereby employees, excluding senior management, can share in the favourable performance of the company. This is in addition to production-related bonuses employees receive during the ordinary course of the year.
