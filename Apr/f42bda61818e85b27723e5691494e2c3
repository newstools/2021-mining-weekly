Dual-listed Energy Fuels, and a team from Penn State University, has been awarded an additional $1.75-million from the US Department of Energy (DoE) Office of Fossil Energy and National Energy Technology Laboratory to complete a feasibility study on the production of rare earth element (REE) products from natural coal-based resources. This also applies to other materials such as REE-containing ores like the natural monazite ore that Energy Fuels is currently processing at its White Mesa Mill project, in Utah. This award follows the DoE providing Energy Fuels a $150 000 contract in 2020 for the successful completion of a conceptual design for the same initiative, resulting in a total award to Energy Fuels of $1.9-million. The feasibility study is intended to support a cost estimate for the production of individually separated rare earth oxides and rare earth metals and alloys from coal-based resources or other resources, including monazite, within the US, with a focus on REEs for the production of commodity- and defence-related products. In a statement on April 23, Energy Fuels confirmed that it is evaluating the potential to develop commercial REE separation, metals, alloys and other downstream REE capabilities at the White Mesa Mill, or nearby, with the goal of fully integrating a commercial national REE supply chain in the coming years. The company's work on the DoE feasibility study is expected to complement these efforts and has the potential to accelerate the company's move into commercial production of separated REE oxides and other value-added REE products in the US in the coming years.
