PERTH (miningweekly.com) â€“ Gold miner Ramelius Resources on Wednesday reported that gold production for the March quarter had reached 66 029 oz. While gold production for the March quarter was down from the 72 896 oz produced in the December quarter, it still fell well within the production guidance of between 65 000 oz and 70 000 oz previously set for the quarter. The Mt Magnet operation contributed 41 832 oz during the quarter under review, with the Edna May mine delivering a further 24 197 oz. Ramelius on Wednesday noted that during the quarter under review, the semi-autogenous grinding mill motor drive bearing at the Edna May operation failed, and after it was replaced, it was subsequently found to be overheating on several restarts to the point that the mill motor was declared faulty. A replacement motor was immediately available, with the installation and commissioning taking four days to complete. An additional three days was spent on the diagnosis period. Meanwhile, cash and gold on hand increased from the A$221.5-million at the end of the December quarter to A$230.6-million at the end of the March quarter.
