Industry organisation the World Federation of Diamond Bourses (WFDB) has launched a campaign, Diamond Aid, to raise funds to help India in its battle against Covid-19. On April 28, the WFDB executive committee held an emergency session over Zoom and decided unanimously to mobilise the international diamond and jewellery industry to donate funds. The goal of the fundraising campaign, organised in coordination with the leadership of the Bharat Diamond Bourse, is to buy essential medications and equipment that are desperately needed by hospitals in Surat and Mumbai. India is in the midst of a wave of Covid-19 infections, with hospital beds and related equipment, as well as oxygen, in short supply. Diamond Aid is a multi-pronged campaign that is being launched through personal appeals to industry leaders, press, the Internet and social media.
