TSX-listed Trilogy Metals reports that activities at its Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects (UKMP) for the 2021 field season will include 7 600 m of drilling at the Arctic project, with the focus on extracting additional material for metallurgical work and for the conversion of mineral resources into the measured category. A further 7 000 m of regional exploration drilling will also be conducted at drill-ready targets. Trilogy in February gave its approval for joint venture (JV) company Ambler Metals to enter into a development funding agreement with the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority (AIDEA). The agreement defines how AIDEA and Ambler Metals – a JV between Trilogy and South32 – will work together on the predevelopment work for the Ambler access project to address funding and oversight of the project's feasibility and permitting activities until the parties reach a decision on the construction of the project by the end of 2024. A budget of $27-million, to be funded by Ambler, has been made available for the advancement of the UKMP for this year. Meanwhile, the AIDEA, the US Bureau of Land Management and the National Park Service have signed right-of-way agreements giving AIDEA the ability to cross federally owned and managed lands along the route for the Ambler Access Project (AAP). The AAP has been granted a 50-year right-of-way on federal lands.
